The bold side part clearly defines the length of the hair, which is carefully coiffed and perfectly textured. The high fade brings a clean look that makes this style appear harder to achieve than it truly is. It\u2019s ideal for almost all hair types."

        "Description": "The crop top with blunt bangs and a low fade is a simple military-inspired style that looks great with minimal effort. Also known as French crop, this style comes with a choppy and textured fringe. The low fade serves as a transition point between the long hair on top and the short hair near the ears. Guys with straight hair will find this one easy to style; just use a little texturizing pomade and comb the hair forward, creating a piecey texture in the process."

The hair on top gradually gets longer from the crown to the forehead, and the fringe is swept straight upward and back to create the classic \u201cpomp\u201d. It\u2019s all about the height, and the mid fade to skin draws the eye upward and helps to create the illusion of more height."

Medium-length layered hair is the perfect canvas for this style. Just pull the hair from the ears and above to the back and secure it into a ponytail. Some loose strands at the forehead and sideburns can add a carefree look."

The hair at the top of the head is left longer than the rest, and the length slowly tapers down the sides and back. The drop fade creates a smooth transition to very short hair around the ears and at the nape. The real fun is the \u201cflip\u201d at the front that mimics a subdued quiff."

Creating this look is as easy as parting the hair in the center and tousling it with a bit of texturizing pomade."

        "Description": "When it comes to stylish hairstyles, the pompadour looks great with a low fade and hard part, giving guys an edgy finish to a classic look. A fade with a hard part is a modern style that can be added to any cut. This look caters to teenage guys and young men who want to curate a bad boy look. If you\u2019re confident in styling your pompadour neatly, then the part would accent the volume and height of your hairstyle. Since the line in a hard part tends to grow out after a week, we recommend regular trims to keep the cut looking sharp."

        "Description": "The high fade is a cool haircut that creates a very short cut on the sides and back, offering a strong contrast for an edgy style. The high fade haircut can look modern and fashionable with many different hairstyles since the tapering process starts very high on the head and shortens at a much faster rate than the low or mid fade. This short haircut strongly emphasizes the styling of the longer hair on top, making it stand out in any crowd.\nThe most common version of this cut is the high skin fade. Many guys like to ask their barber for a line up or shape up as well, thereby outlining their hairline around the temples with sharp lines and edges. The end result is a very stylish and sexy haircut that looks nice with long, medium or short hair on top.\nIf you plan on getting a buzz cut, crew cut, French crop, then you\u2019ll need a high bald fade on the sides to highlight the shorter cut on top. Otherwise, the modern quiff, comb over, faux hawk, side part, slick back, and spiky hair are all excellent styling ideas."

        "Description": "The taper fade is easily one of the most iconic haircut styles in the world. Timeless, classic and classy, the taper fade haircut blends your hair down the sides and back. It\u2019s not as short as a skin or bald cut, but shorter than a classic taper. While still sharp, neat and versatile, the taper is a more subtle trim and will cut your hair without cutting it down to the skin. This leaves the ends of your hair around the hairline and neckline longer than a traditional look.\nThe difference between a fade and a taper is that fades continue blending the hair into the skin whereas tapers end with really short hair. When in doubt, ask your barber for a taper to get a more conservative classic look on the sides and back. While you won\u2019t get the same contrast as a fade, you can style just as many cool hairstyles."

As a barbershop favorite, the skin cut has become popular in recent years as a clean and high-contrast style that gives off a bad boy vibe. Whether you pick a high, mid or low skin fade will depend on how short you want the sides and back cut, but all of these will require your hair to be shaved down to the skin on your head.\nThe low skin fade looks good if you want to wear a comb over, side part, or slick back and still have your hairstyle be acceptable for the office. If you don\u2019t have a dress code to worry about, the mid and high cuts are sexy and popular with young men."

The primary difference is that the modern comb over is less structured, with more flow and texture as all the hair is swept to one side. There are also many different types of comb over hairstyles to get.\nThe low fade comb over is the more old-fashioned version and looks flattering for professionals and older men who don\u2019t want their scalp exposed. The high fade comb over makes for an awesome disconnected hairstyle with thick, longer hair on top and very short sides, while the mid fade may deliver the perfect balance.\nFor additional options, guys may want to consider a taper fade versus a skin fade. The shorter cut can be particularly attractive as a hairstyle for men with receding hairlines or thinning hair. Whether you have thick, fine, curly or wavy hair, the comb over fade remains an elegant style to try!"

You can style the classic version with side-swept hair, a low quiff in front, or tousled and messy. Apply a matte product for a textured finish or a low-shine pomade for some sheen if you have dry hair."

For guys with thin or wavy hair, try styling a comb over or side part. You can even pull off side swept hair for a classy style. Fashionable and modern, long cropped haircuts with bangs are always on-trend."

For a bold look, you\u2019ll want to get a high taper fade that highlights the short to medium length hair on top.\nThe crop fade haircut comes in many variations depending on the tapered sides. To further tailor your cut, talk to your barber about a skin, bald, drop, burst or taper fade cut on the sides and back. Add a line up to shape the hairline and temple area for a cool look.\nWhen styling the French crop fade hairstyle, use a light to medium hold pomade, wax, clay, or cream. A matte product is ideal for a natural textured look. Style the cut loose and messy, neat and classy, brushed forward or swept to the side."

        "Description": "The high taper fade is a trendy short haircut for men who want a bold look that makes a fashion statement. A high taper fade haircut provides a high-contrast style that starts tapering down the sides and back near the top of the head. The high taper delivers a sleek and edgy cut that complements short to medium length hairstyles. When talking to your barber, you can ask for a high skin, drop or burst fade to get a unique look. The high bald fade will taper the cut into the skin for a fresh and sharp finish. This very short high fade haircut blends at a faster rate and generally requires a number 0, 1, or 2 clipper guard size. By drawing attention to the longer hair on top, this tapered style will work with a buzz cut, side swept crew cut, messy crop, quiff, comb over and faux hawk."

The extra texture is great for guys with thick, straight, curly and wavy hair, but can be especially effective at thickening your strands if you have thin hair. When styling a crew cut, use a matte pomade or clay with a light hold for a thicker and fuller appearance."

Shaving a line into your natural part can help you style the crew cut side part hairstyle and help you highlight the direction your hair is flowing."

        "Description": "Dread braids combine two hairstyles into one by taking classics and mixing them together for the ultimate style. What\u2019s instantly obvious is how much texture you get when you decide to braid dreadlocks, as well as the extra volume. The thickness of your hair means you\u2019ll be able to hold styles with less effort, so you can switch up the braiding technique without too many worries or hours of tying! Dread braids are brilliant for men with short hair as shorter cuts prevent them from appearing feminine."

        "Description": "Braids with an undercut ensure that the main feature of your style \u2013 the plaits \u2013 stands out and doesn\u2019t fade into the background. Braids are box office, yet pairing them with an undercut takes it to another level as the sleek nature of your back and sides contrast the longer style on top. Also, there are different versions of undercuts, from faded to disconnected, so your braids will never feel old or tired."

        "Description": "If you want a cool haircut that\u2019s sharp and versatile, braids with a fade are for guys who don\u2019t want to go over the top with their plaits. Sometimes, it\u2019s easy to get caught up in making your braids as big and full of volume as possible, but it can lead them to appear wild and untamed. Implementing a fade allows you to maintain a level of control without losing any of the style as you can simply add plaits to the top hair. The different textures, along with the subtle-yet-powerful contouring from your fade, will leave you looking fresh."

        "Description": "You don\u2019t have to wait a year to grow out your hair since guys can get braids for short hair. The key is to keep the back and sides compact like you would with a regular short style. For example, you can opt for an undercut or a taper fade and leave the top hair longer. With the extra length on top, it\u2019s easy to push the strands upward and tie them into place. As well as the bold contrast, braids for short hair offer lots of creative takes on a classic trend."

        "Description": "Braids for long hair are ideal if your hair grows out rather than down. While it has volume, it lacks the length that you want, which is where plaits come into play. By pulling your hair tight and braiding it down towards your shoulders, you\u2019ll finally get the fully-long trend that you\u2019ve been growing for months. You will need to tie your hair into at least three to four plaits on each side of your head to pull off the effect."

For those who want something less classically stylish, you can place a single braid around the edge of your head and add cornrows to the space in the center."

The regular way to wear double braids is to run two separate plaits from the front of the head to the back; however, you implement extra coolness by forming them into double man buns. As far as fashionable and original braids go, you don\u2019t get more unique multiple buns!"

Of course, if you prefer to keep more hair on top as it\u2019s thinner, you can incorporate a side braid to ensure you don\u2019t miss out on a cool trend."

This braid style is often paired with a fade or shaved sides to highlight the design on top. This way, the contrast of the braids on the top will work perfectly with the shorter length, not to mention the fact that there are tons of different options, from single and double plaits to dreads and locs that flow into a man bun."

The key is to make sure that you have enough length to manufacture your plaits into place with around three to four inches being a good length. Then, it\u2019s all about making your aesthetic as small as possible with the help of microblading techniques that allow for tight and intricate looks. An undercut is ideal for small braids as it emphasizes them."

        "Description": "The buzz cut fade is a modern short men\u2019s hairstyle all around, with faded sides and short hair on top. There are many types of fade haircuts to pair with a buzzed cut. For starters, you\u2019ll want to determine where the tapering begins so you have a choice of a high, mid or low fade. A buzz cut with a low fade begins the tapering just above the ears and stays close to the neckline in the back; whereas, the mid fade starts in the middle of the head and the high fade effectively becomes a high and tight.\nGuys can further tailor the cut by requesting a taper, bald, skin, or drop fade. Ultimately, buzz cut fade haircuts are more versatile and less extreme than traditional, military-inspired hairstyles. Although it\u2019s still very short, a fade incorporates an extra dimension because the look isn\u2019t a uniform length all over the head. Plus, it\u2019s an excellent choice for guys with receding hairlines or thin hair as it adds more volume by making your hair on top appear thicker."

If you want to stand out with buzzed hair and a beard, it\u2019s important to understand how to pull this look off properly. For example, you need to keep your beard groomed and styled because, with short hair on top, more of the focus will be on your facial hair.\nMen with thick hair buzz cuts can enjoy more latitude and grow a long full beard. On the other hand, guys with thin or thinning will want heavy stubble or a well-kept short beard style to draw attention away from the hairline without making the contrast overwhelmingly obvious. Paired with a trendy buzz cut fade where you taper your sideburns, a beard will add texture and dimension to your badass style."

The three best examples of short buzz haircuts are the military induction cut, the burr cut, and the high and tight fade. While not quite a zero, these types of buzz cuts involve a number one all over for a close cut and a taper fade on the sides and back.\nIf your hairline is fuller, a military-style buzz cut is a fantastic way to bring a sharp, masculine feel to your look as the angles are crisp and edgy. Guys with thin hair want to avoid this since the dimensions bring attention to your head. Instead, you should allow for a little extra growth to soften the cut and make it more sophisticated."

        "Description": "The long buzz cut can take many forms, with the most popular being the crew cut mixed with buzzed hair on the sides. Great for men with the right look, a long hair buzz cut offers additional styling options that aren\u2019t available with a shorter cut. For example, a buzz cut with longer hair on top can be styled with pomade or clay for a textured, natural look that adds volume and depth.\nAlternatively, you may prefer to pair a buzz cut with a fringe, Caesar haircut, or a side swept front. A Caesar crew cut is achieved with longer buzzed hair on top using a number 4 guard and paired with a fade on the sides. You can leave the longer bangs brushed forward and hanging over the forehead or swept to the side for a very short League hairstyle."

The contrast creates a bold aesthetic that\u2019s as flexible as it is original. Apply gel, pomade or wax through your hair and style a mini mohawk."

Ultimately, buzzed hair with an undercut can be a great way to change up your look from the classic version of this popular hairstyle."

Generally, a taper fade blends the hair on your sides and back into the scalp, while a taper haircut blends shorter but leaves some hair at the bottom. A buzz cut with a taper is a good hairstyle for professional men or guys who want a short haircut that is smooth and charming without being too edgy.\nTo give a taper fade with buzzed hair, your barber ends the tapering process with a #1 or #2 guard and keeps some length. The buzz cut is still trimmed short all around and will contrast with the shorter faded sides. Fresh and unique, this trend is popular because it softens your head and features, yet is still manly and clean-cut."

You can cut this short hairstyle yourself at home with quality clippers and make it a uniform haircut all around the head.\nIf you like to get trimmed up at a barbershop, the better look is a taper fade on the sides and back with a #1 or #2 cut on top and a line up along the hairline. Stylish for young and older men alike, experiment with a burr haircut and grow a full beard for a hot, youthful aesthetic."

Unlike a traditional buzz cut, the most popular variation of the butch haircut is the brush cut fade. With longer hair on top, the fade blends the sides and back of the head to taper the look and create contrast.\nThe back and sides gradually reduce in length as they reach the ears, creating a short-yet-dense visual. A brush cut is ideal for guys who wear an Ivy League cut as once it grows, it will transform into a standard crew cut."

Without the ability to mix up lengths for a striking appeal, you can shave an edgy line into the sides of your head for a modern masculine look.\nWhat makes this trend popular is that you can play around with the line to make sure the novelty isn\u2019t lost. A single line can be wider and thicker if you want to get people\u2019s attention, or it can thin if you\u2019re trying to be subtle. Guys can even get 2 or 3 lines etched into their cut. Also, a line design works as a hard part that highlights a buzzed top and faded or undercut sides."

For guys who want some contrast, ask your barber for a #1 on top but with faded sides. To maintain this cut and keep it fresh, you\u2019ll need a haircut regularly."

By keeping your hair short and trimmed, others won\u2019t be able to compare your receding hairline with the hair on top.\nThe other advantage is that men\u2019s short haircuts are clean, easy to get, and simple to style. If you plan on applying a styling product, just make sure to use a clay or wax to give your strands a thick look. However, remember to not apply too much product on thinning. Clumping your hairs can leave gaps and expose the scalp, giving off the appearance that you are balding in other areas."

        "Description": "If you have long hair and want to keep it, there are ways for men with receding hairlines to make long hair look good. Nowadays, the hottest long men\u2019s hairstyles are the man bun, male ponytail, and free-flowing natural hair. In fact, the man bun fade offers the best of both worlds \u2013 short sides and back, and a long top that is pulled back.\nIf you plan on styling your long hair,\u00a0just apply a light hold, no shine wax, clay or cream for a bit of texture and control. Nevertheless, it is important to note that guys with thin or fine hair shouldn\u2019t style a long look. Using long thin hair on top will not distract people from your deep hairline, but actually compound the problem."

A medium length of hair on top allows guys to style a comb over, quiff, pompadour, faux hawk, brush back, and a variety of other cool styles. Not only are these some of the most fashionable haircuts for men right now, but these cuts combine perfectly with faded sides."

While the buzz cut can be very different and a huge change for guys who are used to having a full head of hair, the style does tone down the hairline significantly.\nAs a masculine and attractive cut, we highly recommend the look for all guys \u2013 White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian."

        "Description": "The crew cut is another great option for making a receding hairline less noticeable. If a buzz cut is too short, the crew cut hairstyle may be a better fit, especially for business professionals who don\u2019t want to expose their scalp in the office.\nSimilarly, an extension of the crew cut would be the Ivy League, which is generally a longer crew cut with a side swept front. These classic haircuts for men can be cut more traditionally, or trimmed with a fade on the sides for a modern variation."

        "Description": "The comb over hairstyle is shaping up to be a barbershop favorite, whether guys are balding or not. In fact, the comb over fade can be the perfect haircut if you have full, thick hair because you can part your hair to one side and hide your receding hairline as you brush the style over.\nHowever, it is critical to mention that the comb over haircut should not be worn by men with thin hair. Parting your hair when you are thinning on top is a recipe for disaster, and guys should just wait to grow their hair out longer or get a shorter cut."

Depending on the type of styling product you apply, guys can even choose between a textured brush back and a slick, shiny finish."

As long as you get a mohawk with trimmed sides, you can customize the shape, width and height of the hair on top any way you want. Ultimately, the signature strip in the middle that comprises the mohawk hairstyle is perfect for guys who are balding, thinning or suffering from receding hair."

Instead, the faux hawk fade takes advantage of the short faded hairline with a less drastic approach. By pushing your hair towards the center, drawing attention to the unique style on top, and minimizing the contrast on the sides, the fohawk haircut will make your receding hairline disappear."

The process of fading from one length to another is generally achieved using hair clippers. Because the fade comes in a variety of styles, it is important to tell your barber the type of fade haircut you want. You can choose a\u00a0low, mid or high fade to determine where the cut is tapered. You can also decide how short to fade the cut by asking for a bald fade, which will blend your hair into your skin."

The undercut can be combined with a range of men\u2019s hairstyles to create a trendy look. The hair on top can be combed over, swept to the side, slicked back, brushed up, styled into a pompadour, or made to get a\u00a0quiff. Ultimately, the undercut is one of the coolest \u201cshort on the sides, long on the top\u201d haircuts you can have these days."

A high bald fade haircut starts near the top of your head and quickly blends down to the skin for a very tight finish. The cut offers a ton of contrast, really accentuating the hairstyle on top.\nThis can work well with short haircuts like the buzz cut or crew cut, medium length hairstyles like the faux hawk or slick back, and finally long hair like a man bun or top knot. Some popular styles to consider include the high skin fade comb over, quiff, and pompadour."

Bold and masculine, men with large cornrow braids often pull off the straight back pattern with a beard and clean cut."

        "Description": "Short sides long top hairstyles for men are the latest fashion in barbershops around the world.\u00a0One of the reasons these modern haircuts have become part of this hot new hair trend is that buzzed sides are clean, fresh and easy to maintain. And with so many different types of fades (high, low, mid, bald, taper) to get on the sides and back, guys can tailor their cuts any way they want.\nThe challenge really comes down to how to style the long hair on top. Loose, natural, textured, shiny, or messy, styling longer hair means you need good hair products. A matte pomade or hair wax can be perfect for a textured quiff or comb over fade.\nA light to moderate hold pomade or wax will allow you to control your hair and style it to your desire, but still offer plenty of volume and natural texture.\nOtherwise, guys should use a shiny, strong hold pomade to style a slicked back undercut or classic pompadour fade. These products work best on short to medium length hair that needs to be structured and neat.\nHowever, for men with long hair that is shoulder length or longer, we highly recommend a light clay or cream. These styling products provide maximum volume, movement, and flow for a beautiful finish.\nWhatever your personal sense of style, there\u2019s a cool cut for you. Here are the best short sides long top men\u2019s haircuts to show your barber!"

High taper fades generally expose more of the back and side of the head.\nOn the other hand, the low taper fade starts just above the ear and curves around the hairline down the neck. The low fade is generally more conservative and better for professionals as well as older men.\nThe mid fade is a balance of the two and blends in the middle. If you aren\u2019t sure which type of fade to get, the medium fade haircut is a good place to start.\nNow that you\u2019ve determined where the fading will start, you need to decide how short to go. A classic taper fade blends short to shorter hair, whereas the the skin or bald fade will gradually disappear into the skin on your scalp.\nUltimately, a fresh short sides and back haircut can really make all the difference in how hot your style will look."

        "Description": "Short hair twists work well for a wide variety of hair types, and look best with fade haircuts. To pull off short twists, you will need at least an inch and a half to two inches of hair on top. While twists on short hair can unravel quickly, the hairstyle is worth the effort.\nJust remember that if your hair is tightly coiled, short twist styles can be less prominent or defined. On the other hand, if your hair has much looser coils, the twists will stand out for a bold look."

Depending on the size of the medium hair twists you choose, they can either add volume or fall to the side like a braid. It\u2019s possible to create a unique look by carefully dividing each sectioned twist so the scalp shows through in triangles, squares, or even spirals. There\u2019s no limit to the creativity."

Most guys love the two strand twist fade because it combines short sides with longer braids on top for a universally trendy style.\nAll you have to do to get the 2 strand twist is section out your hair, then divide each section into two pieces and twist them together. You can make these sections as large or as small as you want, and you can even add adornments to really make it your own. Ultimately, two strand twist styles for men offer a classic yet masculine way to style your natural hair."

However, unlike many of the other twist hairstyles out there, twisting longer strands can take some time to put in.

If you have always wanted to rock the high top fade, try pairing it with some long twists on top.\nYou can style the high top twist with the hair on top going all the same direction, or you can leave it messy and scattered for an edgy look. Like the temp fade, twists with a high top fade can help elongate your head and make you look slightly taller."

The faux hawk twist is far less rigid, and it affords you numerous options.\nFor example, you could go with shorter twists in a strip down the center of your head that are all the same length and completely shaved sides, or you might choose to do a variety of twist lengths and a taper fade on the side."

Similar to box braids, these types of twist styles offer phenomenal ways to add something personal to the classic two-strand twist."

To create them, stylists use tools called loc or twist sponges. The stylist inserts your hair into the holes and then twists the sponge, which takes your hair with it.\nAt the end of the process, the hair is removed from the sponge, leaving twists behind. No matter how dense or tight your curls might be, this option can work for you \u2013 and it works for a variety of hair lengths."

To do it, just create standard two strand twists, but make them much thicker and chunkier than normal. This is a relatively simple twist to create at home or in a salon, and it\u2019s fairly easy to take out.\nIf your hair is long, you can pull multiple twists back into a ponytail for a fashion-forward look, and if your hair is shorter, you can choose to spike your thick twists for some personality."

As always, you need tapered sides and longer hair on top, but you should choose the length based on your tresses. Men with tight, bouncy curls will prefer more hair at the front and in the middle as it utilizes your texturized kinks. Guys with waves should keep it shorter as your hair is straighter and not as easily discernible."

However, Travolta reshaped the culture in the movie \u201cSaturday Night Fever\u201d with his gelled slicked back hair that was also coiffed and full of volume. For this, you\u2019ll need a thick brush and lots of hairspray."

It was a professional style for men who preferred a clean-cut and classy image rather than the bolder 70s styles. Greaser hair is making a comeback by keeping the back and sides shorter and the top longer for volume and contrast. Use a water-based styling product if you don\u2019t like the original oily look."

        "Description": "The 90s mohawk involved shaving off the hair on the sides completely to leave a long strand of hair in the middle. The mohawk is drastic but noticeable and hard to ignore, and that made the hairstyle perfect for punk rockers. Current versions of the mohawk aren\u2019t as close cut and are incredibly versatile. If you\u2019re not a fan of the shaved sides mohawk, the best alternative is a tapered fade with a faux hawk as it lets you play around with the length and switch from long to short, depending on your preference."

For volume and height, grow your curls out into a thick afro and then brush it out. However, the curly frohawk doesn\u2019t always need a thick afro. Kinky hair and tight curls look good with a mohawk fade, full beard and shaved line part. Whether you want long, medium-length or short curly hair, this hairstyle is masculine and hot."

With a short fade or undercut on the sides and a messy textured quiff hairstyle on top, guys will have a very fashionable look.\nTo get the quiff, your barber will need to leave the hair at the front of your head longer, getting progressively shorter towards the back. Try a high skin fade on the sides for an edgy look that emphasizes the flowing finish. Others like to combine this hairstyle with an undercut or taper to keep it neat and classy.\nAs one of the best haircuts for men with thick short to medium-length hair, guys can\u2019t go wrong with a quiff. Just remember that styling the quiff will require good hair products and time. To style a quiff, you\u2019ll need a good pomade, wax or cream to maximize hold, volume and texture.\nThe beauty of the quiff hairstyle is you can leave it messy, textured, spiky, brushed back or any combination."

Whether you have short, medium or long hair on top, combing your hair to one side can look good on any guy.\nThe modern version of this classic style is the comb over fade. With faded sides that accentuate the styling on top, guys can add a hard part and loosely brush over their hair for a unique look. Use a matte styling product with moderate to low hold for a casual, flowing finish.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a good gentleman\u2019s hairstyle that screams smart yet fun, the comb over could be the perfect cut and style for you."

From the slicked back undercut to the slick back fade and textured brush back, guys have plenty of options for the look.\nStart with a short sides, long top haircut and run product through your hair. We recommend a matte pomade for a natural look and flow. Then use a comb to pull everything back.\nSlicked back hairstyles work with all hair types. With longer, curly hair, slick back hair will have more texture and bounce. On the other hand, guys with straight thick hair can brush it back into a sleek, sexy style."

As a cool hair trend, the undercut is versatile enough to work with all types of haircut styles, including the quiff, comb over, slick back, faux hawk, and fringe.\nStylish and badass, the essence of the undercut is short sides that are all one length. Variations on just how short those sides are and how high the cut starts are numerous. However, guys do have a choice between the disconnected undercut and undercut fade.\nBoth are edgy and require no styling, but do need regular cuts to maintain. On the flip side, guys can always get a shaved sides hairstyle.\nThe undercut hairstyle for men looks great with short and long hair on top. Undercuts also pair very nicely with full beard styles for a manly look."

The medium fade is ideal for gentleman who want to avoid exposing too much scalp but want short sides for simple styling.\nLastly,\u00a0guys need to decide just how short the fading will go.

However, the taper haircut stops before the hair gets super short and does not blend into the skin. Depending on your preferences, a tapered hairstyle can be achieved with longer hair on the sides if the barber uses scissors instead of clippers.\nFor a regular haircut that looks much like a classic gentleman\u2019s hairstyle, a taper could be a good option to consider. Leaving more length by choosing a taper haircut will create a more relaxed, traditional look."

The low fade haircut on the sides starts the blending process right above the ears and curves around near the neckline.\nFor a timeless, clean-cut men\u2019s hairstyle you can wear anywhere, try slicking back your hair with a low fade."

        "Description": "The high fade slick back offers a more modern and badass twist to your hair. As a very short haircut on the sides, the high fade is slick and hot. With the emphasis on the thicker, longer hair on top, this kind of slick back hairstyle works well for guys of all hair types, especially men with receding hairlines\u00a0or a widow\u2019s peak.\nSimply ask your barber for a high taper fade or high skin fade on the sides and leave at least 3 inches of hair on top. If you prefer more length, you can always grow your hair out longer. Afterwards, you have the option of styling a textured brush back with volume and height or slicking back your hair with a strong pomade."

        "Nom": "Slick Back Taper",
        "Description": "The slick back taper is a great haircut if you don\u2019t want your barber to buzz down to the skin. The difference between a taper and a fade is that the taper isn\u2019t as short, leaving hair at the end of the gradient. On the other hand, the fade trims all the way down to the skin on the back and sides.\nIn the end, the slick back taper resembles more of the traditional look. We\u2019d recommend the classic slick back for older men who want a handsome, mature style for their age."

The bald fade is edgy and fashionable, allowing your barber to taper down to the skin on the back and sides. This effortless blend provides a sexy contrast and truly focuses the eyes on the brushed back hair on top. Combining a skin fade with a slick back hairstyle is one way to make sure you stand out in a crowd."

        "Description": "The fade is a timeless and stylish haircut. Black men have the option to pick a high, mid, or low taper fade haircut on the sides and back to complement their longer hair on top. To make the cut edgy and bold, ask your barber for a bald fade that blends the hair into the skin.\nPictured is one of the most popular thot boy fade haircuts. With a low skin fade on the sides and messy curly hair on top, this look is attractive and fun. For a fresh hairline and clean edges around the temples, get a line up. The long twists are easy to style with a curl-enhancing smoothie and hair twist sponge.\nLike the example above, this high bald fade and short to medium-length curly thot boy hairstyle is classy and hot. The faded sides are low-maintenance and sleek, while the long curls on top look natural and nicely styled. To get this curly hairstyle for black hair, you\u2019ll need to grow out your hair at least 3 inches long.\nThis style works for a number of haircuts, hair lengths, and face shapes. Simply use a leave-in conditioner and work the product into your hair with a sponge to get the desired look."

With short dreads on top, women find this look irresistible.\nAlternatively, you can choose to get a low taper fade on the sides and back that drops down to the neckline.

        "Description": "While curly hair can sometimes be a pain to style and maintain, there are certainly ways to manage and tame curls. With a curly hair fade, the faded sides are cut very short to minimize styling, and the longer top is trimmed to create tight curls. A cool beard or hair design can add extra flair.\nThis thot boy curly fade haircut starts with a low taper fade on the sides with thick, curly hair on top. The faded sides shave the sideburns and then drop down to the neckline. The thick curls are styled messy but tight for a handsome finish. The short beard is short and well-groomed for a rugged but clean finish.\nAnother example is this low skin fade with a shaved part on the sides. The blending drops in the back for a smooth neck fade. On top, the curls are more defined and distinct as a result of applying a light styling product. The additional benefit is that curly hair products for men minimize frizz while offering control. The heavy beard stubble is manly and flattering."

        "Description": "Depending on how extreme you want your fohawk hairstyle to look, the sides should be clipped between a number 2 and 5, or simply trimmed shorter with scissors. Styling the faux hawk requires some gel or pomade in order to create the point in the middle of the head. Comb product through your hair in an upwards motion, and then press it together until it forms the style you want."

        "Description": "There are numerous ways to achieve sexy short textured hair, whether your classic look is a crew cut, short spikes, or even something more Ivy League. Although each of these is well-suited for shorter hair, keep in mind that you will need at least two inches of length to get the a tousled look with a natural finish.\nThe crew cut is longer on top and fades down into a taper or skin fade. For edgy short hair, definitely get a high bald fade or a razor fade with shaved sides. Tousling the hair on top using a matte pomade or wax can help you create this look.\nShort spikes are also easy to create with a small amount of styling product. Just apply the strong-hold product and shape the spikes in any size and direction you\u2019d like with the option of getting a faux hawk. Even Ivy League haircuts can be transformed into something textured and trendy. Apply your product and then create your side swept look for that natural finish."

You can do a textured comb over, faux hawk, mohawk, quiff, or pompadour in a matter of minutes.\nFor styles like the pompadour and quiff that rely on extra volume, you\u2019ll want a thick wax or clay pomade that offers moderate hold. Apply it to barely-damp hair and use a natural hair brush at first to move your hair in the right direction and help develop lift and flow. Then use your fingertips to put the defining details and get your desired style.\nAlthough you can style men\u2019s textured haircuts with hair of any length, medium-length styles offer the most versatility and styling options."

Ultimately, long textured hair is the best long hairstyle for guys who want a natural look."

The crop top haircut is best for men with short, thick hair. By combining faded sides or a high undercut with a very short haircut on top, the crop top offers an easy-to-get, simple-to-style look.\nSimply put, it\u2019s a longer, thicker version of a buzz cut with a more distinct fade. For more contrast, we recommend the high skin fade on the sides and back. Once you have the cut, just apply your matte pomade or wax and mess it up for a cool, casual finish."

Apply the product to your damp hair, run your hands through your hair in all different directions, and then let it air dry."

You can even ask your stylist for a disconnected undercut where he will shave or buzz the sides and back of your head for more contrast. As one of the best short sides long top styles, textured undercut hairstyles like the brush back and pompadour are chic and sexy."

        "Description": "If you\u2019re excited to try these manly haircuts with beards, check out these modern cuts and styles with epic beards to get ideas on how to grow, trim, and style your look.\nFor example, one of the hottest cuts and styles for young men and boys is the undercut with beard. The undercut is a very short haircut for guys that accentuates the longer hair on top, and a full beard simply plays on that contrast in shading.\nSimilarly, the fade haircut offers all types of different cuts. Men\u2019s fades allow for a high, low, mid or bald cut to determine where the tapering starts and how short the hair will go. Guys can always choose to get shaved sides or a shaved head with a cool beard.\nWith so limitless styling options, many of the best short haircut styles look good with beards. Finding a good beard style for your short hair is easy with the pictures below!"

If you want the traditional retro version of the style, guys should apply a high hold pomade with shine for a slick, wet finish.\nIf you\u2019re more interested in the modern pompadour, try a matte hair product for a natural look. Either way, this classy men\u2019s hairstyle is edgy and bold."

Although you can use a strong hair product to create a less messy, neater version of the look, we recommend a light to medium hold pomade, wax or cream for maximum movement and flow. The end result is a classic men\u2019s hairstyle that will never go out of style."

Although both hairstyles are known for their smart, dapper look, the comb over hairstyle flows more and doesn\u2019t offer the same structured finish as the part. The vintage comb over haircut requires short tapered sides cut with scissors, and a short to medium length top styled with shiny pomade.\nHowever, the comb over fade is a much cooler modern variation. Guys have the choice of a high, mid, or low fade on the sides, with the option of tapering or fading into the skin. Similarly, you can pick an undercut for a one-length cut. Lastly, the hair on top is often textured for a more natural look. The final look is a trendy style that\u2019s hard to beat in terms of versatility."

        "Nom": "Round",
        "Description": "A round face is quite common for men, and if the outline you drew in the mirror remotely resembles a circle, then you likely have a round head shape. Round faced men are defined by equal widths and lengths, and guys who have round face shapes do not have especially angular faces. Specifically, round faces are soft without sharp jawlines or cheekbones. The best haircuts for round faces are those that make the head appear longer and give the illusion of a more angular, chiseled appearance.\nFor one, keep the sides and back of your hair short; longer hair in these areas can actually make your head look wider and have the opposite effect. For the hair on top, you\u2019ll want to choose a modern hairstyle with a little height and volume or something you can style asymmetrically to lengthen the face. A side swept fringe, comb over, side part, or Ivy League cut trick the eye into believing your head is longer than it really is and minimize the roundness of your face."

A little fringe can provide a lengthening effect as long as the hair doesn\u2019t lie flat and you use a blow dryer to create a flowing style.\nWe highly recommend guys ask their barbers for an undercut or faded sides, specifically a high skin fade. A beard can work as long as it accentuates the angles of your jawline rather than hiding them. The perfect beard would be thick stubble or a long, full beard."

With a face that is longer than your cheekbones, a forehead that is wider than your jaw, and a head shape that is curved rather than angular, the best hairstyles for the oval face man require volume on top.\nIn this case, it\u2019s best to avoid styles like bangs and fringes that fall across your forehead since these can make the rounder lines of your face more prominent. Your goal should be to balance the roundness of your face visually, and the best way to do this is with a cut that is short on the sides and longer on the top. You can use wax or clay for a textured finish that will add extra volume and height, if necessary."

Similarly, the faux hawk, comb over fade, and slick back undercut are also ideal cuts.\nOverall, short to medium-length hair is perfect for styling good oval face hairstyles. Further, men with oval faces often look best without facial hair, but if you prefer to grow a beard, thick stubble or a short beard can offer a masculine look."

Square face men have jaws and foreheads that are almost exactly the same width. As a matter of fact, these symmetric qualities are what many people find attractive in a man. The best haircuts for square faces accentuate the manly features you already have by keeping hair short.\nFor starters, hairstyles for men with square faces should start with a fade on the sides. Then think about\u00a0short to medium length styles with just a hint of volume on top. If you want longer hair, consider a high skin fade or undercut to increase contrast, emphasize the height of your hair, and elongate your face slightly. Short sideburns are excellent choices for square faces as well."

A hard side part with a bald fade can highlight your rugged features. Also, a textured pompadour is always a great choice, particularly if you choose a wax or clay for a matte, natural look to your hair. This concept extends to other medium and longer hairstyles, including the quiff, brush back, faux hawk, and comb over.\nNevertheless, the square face allows for guys to get very short to short haircuts, including the buzz cut, crew cut, high and tight, and French crop. We highly recommend that any cool cuts and styles for square faces be paired with short faded sides or an undercut.\nAs for facial hair, shorter is better, but be sure to avoid a thick, long beard that can hide your strong jawline rather than accentuate it. Growing a beard can be awesome and badass, but heavy stubble is the hottest style you can wear."

This can make your face appear even longer and take away from the angular characteristics of your cheekbones and jawline. Instead, find cuts and styles that are very short to medium-length without height."

However, instead of a very short hairstyle, you may consider a taper or low fade with a comb over, slick back, textured quiff, man bun, or top knot.\nGuys with long faces can grow facial hair, but the best beard styles will range in length from light stubble to thick, short beard. Ultimately, haircuts for oblong faces need to maintain the head\u2019s dimensions and avoid making anything look longer than it actually is."

        "Description": "A triangle face is fuller near the jawline and narrower at the forehead, only slightly resembling the geometric shape. If you have a triangle face shape, the outline on your mirror is narrower around your temples than your jaw, with angular features that are sharper rather than rounded. While there are a number of awesome triangle face shape hairstyles, some are more ideal than others.\nHaircuts for men who have a triangle face shape require some thickness on the sides and plenty of length on top. You will want to create the illusion of volume from the temples upward and guys with thick hair can get the hottest medium to long men\u2019s hairstyles."

        "Description": "The best haircuts for the triangle face shape are classic tapers and low fades that build width on the sides. These cuts work especially well for men who have curly or thick hair. Couple your tapered or faded sides with a long comb over, pompadour, quiff, textured brush up, modern faux hawk, or messy hair. An angular fringe can also be styled to highlight the forehead and minimize the strong chin.\nMen with triangle faces should consider clean-shaven styles; otherwise, avoid a full beard and instead opt for very short and well-groomed beard styles. A short, thick beard or light stubble can maybe soften the chin and jawline."

        "Description": "A diamond face is one with a well-defined chin and jawline alongside high cheekbones. If your face is longer than it is round, and if your chiseled, sharp jaw is the widest part of your face, you likely have a diamond face shape. The best haircuts for diamond faced men are numerous, but the diamond shape is well-suited for the \u201crugged\u201d appearance, complete with longer hair and a full beard.\nIf you have thicker hair, think about growing it out long and using it to your advantage to create flowing layers that sweep over your forehead. For plenty of movement and a free-flowing style, think textured, natural hairstyles with volume and height. Because your face is angular, avoid cuts that are too symmetrical or consist of completely clean lines. Instead, always think textured, and use a good pomade, wax or clay to separate sections and add volume to your hair."

Tousled and messy styles can also create handsome looks.\nAs for the hair on the sides, don\u2019t pick a bald fade or undercut that blends down to the skin.

Finally, a full beard, thick stubble or even a goatee can help add width to your jaw and chin."

        "Description": "Though the fade haircut has been around almost as long as barbers themselves, the taper fade continues to be the basis for most men\u2019s haircuts. This is a testament to how good fades look with so many different styles, providing a low-maintenance, fresh cut that focuses the eyes on the styled hair on top.\nWhile there are various different types of fade haircuts to choose from, the cutting technique and finish is generally the same. To cut a fade, barbers will blend hair short to shorter down the sides and back toward the nape of the neck.\nThere are high, mid, and low fades to determine where the tapering starts. The high fade starts at the top of the sides and back of the head and the low fade begins right above your ears and neckline.\u00a0Guys can also ask for a taper fade or skin fade, which tells the barber how short to trim the fade.\nIf you need a more conservative, business professional haircut, a low taper fade is your best bet. On the other hand, if you want a seriously bold cut with lots of contrast for an edgy hairstyle, the high fade is far more noticeable.\nFurthermore, the skin or bald fade can offer a very aggressive finish, blending the hair into bare skin. And if you really want a rugged fuck boi look, pair it up with a thick beard. This combination of faded sides, medium to longer hair on top, and a rugged, full beard basically represents the fuckboy starter pack."

The difference between a fade and undercut is that, instead of fading the hair, the undercut is all one-length around the sides and back. As a popular hipster haircut, the slicked back undercut may have been the original fuck boy haircut.\nHowever, with a good disconnected undercut and length on top, guys can create some of today\u2019s best styles, including the pompadour, quiff, and comb over. Undercut hairstyles work nicely for men with straight, thick hair, but the trim can also look great with wavy and curly hair."

With so many ways to style a part your hair and style comb over haircuts, guys should really consider this iconic look. Although the comb over hairstyle was once associated with balding men trying to cover thinning hair, the comb over fade or undercut comb over has completely changed that outlook.\nIn these cases, the comb over can be styled with a shiny or textured finish. The classic look generally requires strong pomade for slick styling, while the modern textured version is best achieved with a medium hold, matte pomade or low shine wax.\nMoreover, the comb over can be styled in different ways. One is with a thick, well-defined part and all the hair swept over to one side for a neat, structured look. The other results in hair being brushed over more naturally for a loose styling.\nUltimately, the comb over hairstyle will give you a great deal of flexibility and allow you to create a number of awesome styles \u2013 classic or modern. With the medium-length to long hair on top, guys can get the quiff, pompadour, slick their hair back or spike it."

Especially popular for younger men, it does require some maintenance which lends to the metrosexual stigma. However, the quiff is more than worth the time to style.\nA mere 3 to 4 inches of hair on top is all that\u2019s needed to create this voluminous style. You might opt to fade the sides or keep them all one length. The choice is yours, but remember that the shorter the sides, the more dramatic the quiff.\nTo style the quiff, simply use a wax hair product if you want a textured, natural look or a pomade for a sleek, shiny finish. Apply the styling product while your hair is still damp, then brush your hair back (or use your fingers if you have natural waves or curls) and blow dry it, paying special attention to the hair at the roots. This will give your quiff its distinctive lift."

Certain versions of the slick back are almost certainly fuckboy hairstyles, and the one that stands out the most is textured brushed back hair.\nHair styling wax, clay, or even mousse will help you achieve the natural flow and volume you\u2019re after; otherwise, a pomade is perfect for the more retro, greaser slick back style.\nThe best thing about this fuck boy cut is the fact that it\u2019s easy enough to take from business to pleasure with nothing more than a brush and your favorite product. Slick it back with a wax that offers moderate shine during the day, then in the evening, work in a little pomade at the roots for a badass hairstyle. Either way, you\u2019re sure to look amazing."

        "Description": "The faux hawk is a fresh take on the mohawk and spiky hair. Also known as the fohawk, the haircut is versatile and stylish yet less dramatic than the traditional shaved sides mohawk. The best version of the style is the fohawk fade, with the short sides highlighting the thick hair on top. The faux hawk hairstyle requires a minimum of 2 to 3 inches of length that you can choose to spike any way you want. The styling on top can be narrow or wide, but the more pointy the hair on top, the bolder the fohawk will look.\nHawk hairstyles are also very flexible because the longer length allows guys to change their style. From brushed up hair to a long fringe to a messy hairstyle, men have a range of options. Similarly, using the right pomade, wax or cream can help a great deal here, but be sure to choose one with the appropriate level of hold for the best results."

Clean edges and a neat neck taper can make all the difference in keeping your look fresh."

Formerly a female hairstyle, the pompadour has become one of the trendiest hairstyles for men. A traditional pompadour is worn with short sides, as the hair is swept upwards and backwards. Today, there are a variety of pompadour hairstyles to try out, ranging from classic, angular, extreme, and modern cuts."

        "Description": "If you\u2019re not ready to fully embrace the pompadour, tease the look by trying out the more versatile quiff instead. Whether it\u2019s the short and spiky quiff, long and textured quiff, or the voluminous messy version, there\u2019s a quiff style for everyone. No matter the varied sizes of the back and sides, they should always be kept shorter than the front to emphasize contrast."

Men who preferred short hair were usually the demographic of choice, but today, fade haircuts are being embraced by men of all hair lengths and styles. There are plenty of directions to take the fade haircut: high bald fade, low skin fade, burst drop fade, comb over fade, disconnected fade and more."

The modern slick back involves keeping the sides and back of your head in an undercut or high fade haircut, while the top has enough length to \u201cslick back\u201d with pomade. The hairstyle may date back to American greaser culture, but modern men are taking the slick back in bold new directions.\nIf the modern pomp, quiff, and slick back didn\u2019t inspire you, here are a few more Euro hair styles that may better fit you!"

Played by Cillian Murphy, Tommy Shelby is a crime boss with a stylish short haircut that looks masculine and edgy. The actor\u2019s cut reflects his edgy, criminal lifestyle. While his classic undercut does not require any tapering, modern gentlemen may choose a fade to complement their disconnected style. For a tapered finish, you\u2019ll want to ask your barber for an undercut fade that balances these awesome haircuts.\nThe sharp, shaved lines of this cut imitate the traditional style worn by street gangs in the late 1800s and early 1900s. While Tommy Shelby has short hair, there is extra length left in the front to style a sweeping fringe. The layered cut is left textured and loose, fitting beneath a newsboy cap. This angular cut works best on guys with longer oval face shapes and strong jawlines. If you have a square or round face, ask your barber to assess your proportions to create a variation of the cut that works for you.\nCillian Murphy\u2019s Peaky Blinders haircut was largely inspired by modern hair trends rather than actual styles of 1920\u2019s England, the setting of the show. If you\u2019re trying to get Tommy Shelby\u2019s hairstyle from the show, your local barber should be able to cut and style this look with easy.\u00a0Men with short hair will need to grow it out before taking the plunge since this cut requires 2 to 3 inches of length to look good. You\u2019ll need to ask for a number 1, 2 or 3 clipper guard on the sides and back for a short undercut haircut. The longer hair on top should be cropped and layered for a stylish finish. When styling the look, you\u2019ll need a hair dryer and a light to medium hold hair product such as pomade, wax or clay for a natural matte finish."

The suave and sexy aesthetic can also feature a hard part with a shaved line for a bolder look.\nTo get this haircut, talk to your barber about cutting a side part or comb over with a fade on the sides and back. The longer hair on top can be cut to your desired length. To style this look, you\u2019ll need slightly damp hair and a strong styling product like a pomade or gel with a high shine finish. After sectioning, brush your hair back and to the side in a diagonal direction. Try using a blow dryer with a light heat setting to create subtle waves."

Leaning hard into its punk roots, the sides are disconnected from the top to create the hawk. Whereas the traditional look would go super short on the sides, this approach features a fade to add cleanliness and depth. Have fun and add some lines into the fade to show everyone that you\u2019re different."

These days, it is common to pair this look with an undercut or a deep side part, but the traditional style was paired with a mid fade."

The messy look applies to the voluminous section of hair, which often boasts a bit of disheveled fringe. The contemporary version of the cut emphasizes the difference in length top and the sides, but the traditional version is much softer and far less severe."

While you can choose a taper on the sides and back, a skin fade offers the contrast for a bold touch."

It starts with the traditional 50s-style pomp and a sleek taper fade on the sides, but rather than styling the hair straight upward or slightly off to one side, this style has a very defined swoop. Start with slightly damp hair, apply a strong gel that maintains its wet look, and then direct the hair just behind the forehead upward. Then, carefully tuck the ends of this section of hair just behind the volume to create the wave that gives this look its character."

A cowlick can be paired with a quiff, a modified ducktail, or even a high pompadour."

This cut is best for men who have thicker, coarser hair and a few natural waves."

While the sides and back of the hair resemble the classic gentleman\u2019s cut, all the action happens at the top. The barber or stylist brushes the hair at the top of the head straight up and uses scissors or trimmers to clip in the illusion of a flat surface. The flat top can be very short like a crew cut, but modern versions have seen the hair reach several inches long."

The style gained popularity because it looked handsome and clean without the need for harmful chemicals. This cut is the predecessor to the huge afros that made their way onto the scene in the 1960s and 1970s."

        "Nom": "Jelly Roll",
        "Description": "The jelly roll is named after the shape that the finished style resembles, creating a dramatic and daring style from the 1950s. The hair on top was grown quite long, then combed upward and in to create a loop or rolling wave that looked just like a jelly roll. In some styles, just one roll was placed on the side of the head opposite the part. In others, two rolls were placed directly on top of the head. The modern version is subtler, but it is still viewed as daring and different."

        "Description": "The modern brush back can be defined as a mix between a traditional pompadour and a slick back style. The cut requires longer hair on the top and along the crown and a mid fade on the sides. The longer sections of hair are brushed back and slightly upward, and while some texture may be incorporated into the style, it generally does not boast the wet look that was so common in the 50s."

        "Description": "If you imagine a voluminous pompadour combined with a mohawk, you can almost picture the stylish pomp fringe with fade style. Like the classic pomp, the hair on top is left long and piled high behind the forehead, but it is also lifted and pulled forward to create a mohawk-like fringe. The sides are kept short with a taper fade, and the addition of a line up to clean up the neck and sideburns gives this look even more bad boy personality."

The shape of the roll is visible, and the short sides of the hair create contrast, but the simple addition of thick curls and fringe helps to balance the look in a more contemporary way."

        "Description": "The thick flow-back with ducktail style combines the unique appearance of the ducktail with the flow or flow-back style that became popular during the Victorian era. It involves growing the hair to between two and three inches long, then styling it so that the hair moves straight back and perpendicular to the face. The goal is to cut and style the hair so that when it is brushed back, it creates the illusion of a duck tail at the very center of the back of the head."

It consists of longer hair on top and short hair on the back and sides, about the same as required for a pompadour. Styling involved using combs, heat tools, and various products to create a pompadour-like shape that consists of long, thick waves moving backward from the forehead."

The cut is shaped like a French crop with long hair on top and a high or mid skin fade on the sides, but rather than brushing very short hair forward toward the forehead, heat tools are used to create carefully-shaped waves that move across the head from left to right."

        "Description": "A short spiky hair fade isn\u2019t for the faint of heart, but this trendy and textured style can be a great way to keep hair away from the neck on warmer days. It\u2019s a good idea to create striking contrast and dimension with a bald fade, but don\u2019t be afraid to incorporate shaved lines and highlights for a result that turns heads. For next-level volume, use a small amount of hair powder at the roots."

While it may be difficult to imagine him with long hair now, Clooney was proud to rock a thick, wavy mullet and a fashionably parted bro flow style when he was younger. At one point, he preferred a relatively short and curly mullet with hair that barely reached his shoulders.\nA while later, he had grown it out to medium-length waves in the front and on top with hair well past his shoulders in the back. He wore another long style in 1990 when he was promoting the film Red Surf. This time, he shocked fans with gorgeous feathered layers cut into his shoulder-length hair. Many people believe these flowing hairstyles helped him reach heartthrob status."

During the 1990s, before his hair turned into a gorgeous salt-and-pepper color, Clooney cut his long, luxurious layers in favor of the standard Caesar haircut. The sides are trimmed only slightly shorter than the top, and the hair is gently swept over from a side part.\nThe defining feature of the Caesar cut is the modest wispy fringe adorning the forehead. With several cool variations, it\u2019s hard to find anyone who can wear this style better. He even went back to it a few short years ago, and he paired it with a full beard."

While many men wear a comb over to hide thinning hair at the crown, George Clooney made it his signature formal style. Sometimes he swept it back and over, and sometimes he went for a dapper 1930s-inspired textured comb over.\nTo recreate this style, leave the hair on top three or more inches long, create a side part, and brush your hair over from the part. If you like the wet textured look, use a strong hold styling gel on damp hair, carefully comb the hair over from the side part, and let it air dry."

Although this specific style is great for men who have a similar hair texture, George has worn multiple side part haircuts throughout the years that would look classy on thick, curly, wavy or straight hair."

During the 1990s, he cropped the hair all over his head to less than an inch long, which drew attention to his very pronounced (at the time) widow\u2019s peak.\nAt the 53rd London Film Festival in 1999, he wore a short crew cut with a barely noticeable side part and paired it with a perfectly shaven face. Finally, in 2009, he promoted \u201cUp In The Air\u201d with a very closely-cropped crew cut paired with thick sideburns."

From an undercut to a taper fade on the sides and back, you\u2019ll want this cut to be a short sides, long top hairstyle.\nStyle your comb over to the side or diagonally for lift. Use a light touch for volume and to avoid a flat over-brushed look. Great for straight, thick, and wavy hair, you can\u2019t go wrong with a cool comb over."

After all, teen girls love guys with nice thick longer hair who look like they don\u2019t care. Whether you choose a taper fade or undercut, the cut looks flattering with short sides and long hair on top.\nTo get the look, brush your hair back with a comb and then loosen the strands by running your fingers through. Apply a matte hair product with medium hold that will stay in place without feeling stiff. For extra hold, use a blow-dryer on low heat while you push your hair up and back."

Also known as the Harvard or Princeton haircut, the Ivy League hairstyle is great for preppy teenage boys who want a clean-cut, masculine image.\nStyled by Hollywood heartthrobs Zac Efron and Ryan Gosling, you can keep some length on the sides with a taper haircut or go shorter with a fade or undercut. To be able to sweep the hair in the front or style a combed over hairstyle, leave the top with short to medium length hair. A high shine pomade will enhance the final look."

Whether you want to style a shaggy mop top one day or a quiff, faux hawk, or comb over another, teen boys will love the versatility of this haircut style.\nAnother benefit is that tousled shaggy hairstyles look good with straight, thick, fine, or wavy hair. Of course, if you want to hide an uneven hairline or a large forehead, you can do nothing and let the fringe fall naturally. From short to medium long hair, use a light hair product to keep the cut natural and textured."

By sectioning off your hair, it helps you to achieve a unique curly style that\u2019s trendy and cool. Curly hair teen boys have access to a variety of cuts and styles, so you\u2019ll never feel bored with your look."

To do a pompadour, you need to take your quiff to the next level by styling the front and middle sections of your hair up and to the back.\nFor extra creativity, guys can even brush it up and to the side for a unique diagonal finish. A disconnected undercut will give your cut more definition, especially if your hair is curly or wavy, but the pompadour fade still reigns supreme."

You can style your hair messy and textured, parted to the side for a comb over, or keep it really short to get a high and tight.\nFor a balanced look, you\u2019ll want to try a crew cut with the front part combed to the side to get an Ivy League style. The result is a simple, sexy look that draws attention to masculine features. To get a very short and low-maintenance style, experiment with a buzz cut and pair the look with a beard for a rugged, edgy appearance."

For a unique cut, consider featuring a taper fade haircut on the sides to create a retro high top with a blonde twist. To give your barber a healthy base to work with, keep your hair conditioned with essential oils and rich butter for a few months before taking the plunge. Whether you choose a warmer blonde or decide to go platinum, the afro hairstyle is sure to turn heads."

        "Description": "Blonde hair twists are one of the trendiest styles for black men that work well on all hair lengths for an effortless and fashionable look. As the name suggests, this hairstyle is created by dividing the hair evenly and twisting individual sections around each other. If you have short hair, pair your twists with a striking mid fade for contrast without the hassle of upkeep. Medium and long hair gives guys more freedom to express themselves as the added length allows you to create patterns on the scalp. Classic, low-effort and unique, blonde twists are a badass way to emphasize what you were born with."

Whether you get bleached blonde or platinum hair, there are many different colors that black men can dye their hair. If you choose to go with a platinum hairstyle, this tone can lean white or silver on black skin, making it less attractive than warmer alternatives. Any blonde dye will offer a bold contrast on darker skin tones, making it ideal for those wanting a dramatic transformation. For a masculine touch, pair your vibrant locks with a trendy fade or undercut on the sides and back. This adds dimension to longer hair and will transform any bleached cut from sloppy to chic. Regardless of what length you choose, invest in quality hair products to minimize damage from the bleaching process."

You can then add textured layers that are long enough to create a side-swept bang. This style works best on perfectly straight hair, as you will simply struggle to tame any wavy or curly hair into submission. To keep your look in place, start with day-old hair and apply a light hair clay or styling cream. For versatility and styling options, you\u2019ll want to talk to your barber about the most popular medium length hairstyles with a fade or undercut on the sides and back."

As the long fringe is the standout feature of this cut, you should avoid over-styling the remaining hair."

When styling a charming messy two block hairstyle, you\u2019ll want to focus on achieving the proper shape and maximizing volume. For a thicker look, you should work texturizing products through your hair for extra volume.\nIf you\u2019re working with wet hair, use a round brush to blow-dry your hair upside down and then in different directions. Once your hair is dry, tousle it with your fingertips and allow strands to fall naturally. For best results, make sure you have ample length on top. It\u2019s possible to achieve a messy two block style with shorter hair, but it\u2019s more difficult to style and the results rarely last all day."

It\u2019s tempting to try and hold on to your luscious locks, but once your hair starts thinning, it\u2019s only a matter of time before you should find a new hairstyle. One of the worst things men with thin or thinning hair can do is try and conceal problem areas with a comb over. Not only will this hairstyle draw attention to your bald spots and hairline but it can look unprofessional and embarrassing.\nFor many guys, balding causes anxiety and embarrassment. However, all men will face hair thinning and balding during their lifetime, so it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. The best thing to do when your hair starts balding is to take the plunge with a clean shave, buzz cut or crew cut hairstyle. These styles are stylish and low-maintenance, and often look striking when paired with a beard."

As this cut requires a lot of bravado and confidence to pull off, it\u2019s typically only seen on expressive types who aren\u2019t afraid to stand out from the crowd.\nAs a style that is deemed both harsh and controversial, the skullet is a cut that isn\u2019t worth the risk. If you\u2019d still like to rock an edgy style, there are various mohawk or Viking hairstyles that make an impact without being an eyesore."

Although bowl cuts can look decent on those with hyper-masculine features, they tend to overwhelm most faces and force your hair to lie flat against the head.\nThis cut first burst onto the scene during the Crusades of the 15th century. Despite enjoying various resurgences throughout the years, this blunt and unforgiving cut should remain firmly in the past."

In most cases, the only way to solve the problem is to let your hair grow out and find another professional to give you a cut."

However, neglecting proper hair care and overusing oil-based hair styling products is a recipe for disaster when it comes to any hair texture. Although thin hair is more prone to looking greasy, even thick-haired men can fall foul to bad greasy hairstyles if they overuse product.\nTo keep hair pleasantly slick for a wet look, invest in a water-based pomade and keep your application technique light. This should tame any pesky stray hairs while keeping your overall look sleek and professional."

You can certainly have statement elements at the front, but having massive contrasting sections is asking for trouble when it comes to maintenance and styling."

        "Description": "When asking your barber for a haircut, you\u2019ll need to request the best hairstyle for your face shape. Guys should educate themselves on the different haircuts that suit their facial features and look. Barbers are experienced, but having intimate knowledge about your hair type and what cuts work well for you will save you from getting a bad haircut.\nOval face shapes usually suit a wide range of cuts. This is because oval faces are naturally well-balanced. For a look that\u2019s sure to impress, ask your barber for a pompadour to draw attention to your perfect features.\nConversely, square faces suit undercut hairstyles well as these cuts feature harsh lines that beautifully highlight strong jawlines. Finally, round faces should opt for hairstyles that elongate and add dimension. Quiffs work particularly well here, as they create a wonderful balance and height that makes any facial roundness less prominent.\nThe final thing to consider when you\u2019re choosing a hairstyle is styling. It can be tempting to choose an impressive high-maintenance hairstyle but few men are willing to put in the effort to style complex cuts each day.\nIf you\u2019re unsure about the cut you have in mind, bookmark examples of your favorite haircut styles to show your barber. They should be able to fill you in on the styling steps you\u2019ll need to go through each day to keep your locks in top condition. If the upkeep is too much for you, be sure to discuss viable alternatives."

When considering proper care and maintenance, there are many hair tips and products to learn about to keep your scalp and locks healthy. For starters, you\u2019ll need to know how often you should wash your hair with shampoo. Washing your hair too often is sure to strip your hair of natural oils, but not washing it enough can make your hairstyle look greasy and ugly.\nStriking the perfect balance is all about trial and error, so be sure to experiment with different shampoo and conditioner schedules to figure out what gives you the best results. When in doubt, ask your barber for their professional advice!\nIt\u2019s also important to keep up with regular barbershop visits. Letting your hair grow too long will make it look shapeless and encourage breakage. To keep your cut fresh, visit the barbershop every four or five weeks. This should keep your hair budget manageable while maintaining the health of your hair."

While braids have been around for decades and continue to be cool, Corporate America has been slow to adapt and accept the look. With increased workplace education and diversity, conservative environments will eventually be more open-minded."

Although you may get away with very subtle frosted tips at the workplace, overly bold and contrasting cuts are usually out of the question. The style tends to look too laidback on most guys and rarely pairs well with a sharp suit. Therefore, frosted tips should be left in the past to avoid any unwanted attention at business meetings."

The blowout taper is a great look when going to a club or bar, but guys shouldn\u2019t style their hair this way for the office."

Also known as the shag haircut, this style relies on volume, long layers and texture. Hair is purposefully cut to fall messily and the finished product oozes masculinity. Although you may feel like a rockstar when wearing your hair in this long shaggy style, your employers will probably spurn this edgy cut. As it\u2019s naturally scruffy, it\u2019s considered too informal for most professional settings. It\u2019s possible to style the shaggy haircut in a way that looks less rebellious, but it\u2019s best to stick to shorter styles or less layered cuts that allow you to slick hair back when required."

Also known as a mushroom haircut, this style features bluntly cut bangs all around the head that are brushed forward for a dramatic look. Some guys prefer a shorter fringe, but most bowl haircuts feature heavy bangs that cover the forehead. The longer length may seem weird and over-the-top for some employers and may be seen as an unprofessional choice. Constantly touching and adjusting your hair in the workplace won\u2019t be taken lightly either, so this look is unlikely to be a success in the office."

While casually stylish and modern, this style looks great on teenage boys and young men as it projects a youthful and edgy vibe. The faux hawk can easily be toned down, but not enough to be appropriate for the office. You can style a faux hawk fade in your personal life, but you should comb over or slick back your hair for a business professional look at work."

To change things up, you can mess up the middle section of your hair as the thickness will create a rugged appeal that\u2019s visually striking and modern.

        "Description": "The high and tight with a fade is best for guys with straight, thick hair as it typically minimizes all styling and looks ruggedly handsome. You need around one to two inches of hair on top with a fade haircut on the sides that seamlessly blends the cut. As a hairstyle that lands somewhere between a buzz and crew cut, it has a manly aesthetic since it\u2019s short and trimmed close to the head. Perfect for the warm summer months, the high and tight fade is easy and simple for guys."

Thick hair when it\u2019s long on top is hard to handle as it falls all over your face, yet slicking it back will make sure it flows in the opposite direction. You can combine it with an undercut or high fade, but this adds extra effort into maintaining your style. For a classic slicked back trend, you only require a comb and a strong pomade or wax to keep it in place all day."

Apart from eye-catching, the fohawk is also a clean look since you can line up the sides to ensure there\u2019s another dimension to the cut. This haircut works well for men with thick locks as you need plenty of hair to pull it off. It\u2019s also a smart choice for shorter guys who want to appear taller."

You can get a blowout taper for a classic look or choose a short skin fade haircut on the sides for an edgy modern style.

        "Description": "This is a classic look for men who prefer long wavy hair. It\u2019s easy to style and maintain, and it\u2019s a perfect transitional style if you\u2019ve decided to grow your hair out. Ideally, you will want to keep your hair just at shoulder length in the back with layers. All it takes is an excellent light-hold styling cream or clay to separate and define your waves while holding them in place throughout the day."

        "Description": "This bold style is ideal for creating volume if you have thin or fine hair. The hair in the front is thicker and longer than elsewhere on the head, and the low fade starts very gradually just above the ears. All that\u2019s required for styling this angular fringe is a good cream or curly enhancer (depending on your hair type) and a couple of minutes to place individual strands of hair exactly where you want them."

        "Description": "Coupling medium-length to long hair with a beard is easily one of the hottest men\u2019s hairstyles for guys with wavy hair. Much like other long layered wavy hairstyles, hair should be anywhere from three to six inches in length and cut into layers to add volume, flow and definition. Use your favorite hair product to style your hair while sweeping the front over to one side and giving it a gentle twist. The short beard simply ties the look together and creates a more rugged appearance."

        "Description": "Short haircuts are always trendy for guys, and the best part is how easy these cuts can be to style. In fact, much of the styling starts in the barber\u2019s chair with the medium fade that is tapered down to the skin on the sides and back. The bald fade really accentuates the short but thick wavy on top. Much like a crew cut, this textured hairstyle is low-maintenance and simple to style with just a small amount of matte pomade or clay."

To style a fringe at home, work a good hair product through your hair, from root to tip. Then pull all your hair forward and leave it tousled and messy for a casual, sexy finish. The goal should be a carefree, windblown look."

He\u2019s been enjoying a lot of international success ever since as a solo musician, producer, and featured collaborator.\nWhere his hairstyle is concerned, ASAP Rocky is faithful to his braids. He styles them in various ways, often in a ponytail. The box braids give him an eccentric look, which we\u2019re guessing is exactly what the rapper was going for."

He likes to joke that he is the \u201cghetto Martha Stewart\u201d.\nAs for his hairstyle, Coolio\u2019s braids are best described as absolutely insane. Always sticking out and up, his braided hair is instantly recognizable. There was even a time the rapper would wear his braids in two pigtails. Fortunately, Coolio has the swagger to pull off this look with style."

Once he released his debut album in 2012, he was already a big deal.\nMill is currently sporting a polished look, so you might not even know that the rapper wore braids throughout his childhood and mixtape days. Quite the contrast with the classic Caesar cut he adopted once gaining notoriety, his new haircut likely signals his newfound prestige. Nevertheless, Meek Mill\u2019s cornrow braids continue to be a stylish hairstyle for men."

It all culminated with his death due to an accidental drug overdose.\nBut while his personal life was troubled, his iconic spiked-up braids were always on point.

        "Description": "The butch cut is similar to the crew cut, but the main difference is that the crew cut haircut is longer all over with extra length in the front. Butch haircuts are really short and don\u2019t need any styling or product. Meanwhile, the fringe of the crew cut is generally swept to the side for a parted style.\nIt\u2019s also easy to do a butch cut at home using just your clippers, but we advise you to visit a barbershop to get a crew cut. The best crew cut haircuts are faded on the sides and back with longer, layered hair on top. Getting a properly tapered fade is essential to pulling off the hairstyle."

Also known as a short butch, the burr haircut is slightly longer than the induction cut, which is the type of haircut given to new recruits in the military. The induction is achieved by buzzing the hair completely with no guard on the clippers.\nTo get the burr cut, you\u2019ll want to use a #1 or #2 guard all over. Your hair will be very short, so your facial features will take center stage. For a rugged manly look, grow a full beard and get a fade on the sides to complement your short hair."

Cut by shaving the sides and back down to the skin while leaving only a strip of hair in the middle, long mohawk styles are achieved with strong styling gel. The modern variation pairs a mohawk with a fade or undercut to create a less extreme finish."

Style your hair messy or neat with your preferred products."

        "Nom": "Short Hairstyles",
        "Description": "Short haircuts are the traditional look for balding men. Short hair on top with a fade on the sides and back minimizes the contrast and takes the attention away from bald spots. Similarly, guys with thinning hair on the crown, a widow\u2019s peak, or a receding hairline can get very short hairstyles to make the balding hair part of their look.\nYoung men who can pull off edgy modern haircuts will want to ask their barber for a high skin fade and a buzz cut or crew cut on top. Even a short comb over fade with a side swept front or slicked back undercut can look nice.\nTo maximize coverage, volume and texture, use a matte pomade or wax and style the short hair messy. Avoid gels that clump hair together.\nOlder men may not be able to get very short bald fade cuts that blend into the skin and expose the scalp. Good haircuts for older balding men include a high taper fade on the sides for a classic look. The styling on top can be brushed back, parted to the side, or styled messy and textured."

        "Description": "Bald men with long hair may prefer to find longer hairstyles to try. While it may seem counter-intuitive, hiding bald spots with long hair is actually harder unless you also have thick hair.\nIn fact, guys with thinning hair can exacerbate the issue and make it more obvious that they are trying to cover up certain areas. For this reason, we highly recommend a medium to longer hairstyle on top with short sides.\nFor instance, men with widow\u2019s peaks or receding hairlines can get shaved or faded sides. A high fade can blend the hair for a gradual transition. Long haircuts for balding men include the pompadour, slick back, comb over, modern quiff and messy mop top. Textured styling with wax or clay can give your hair a thicker, fuller look."

This very short haircut will focus attention back to your face and is especially ideal if you have a masculine face shape.\nWhile there are different types of buzz cuts you can get, men can generally cut their own hair at home. Using professional hair clippers, apply a number 2, 3 or 4 guard size and buzz your entire head one length. One variation of a buzzed hairstyle is the high and tight fade, where the short hair on top is complemented by faded sides.\nIf you want low-maintenance haircut styles for balding hair that are effortless and require no styling, you\u2019ll appreciate the buzz cut."

When cut and styled properly, the modern comb over fade can do a great job of incorporating your receding hairline or widow\u2019s peak into your hairstyle.\nWith medium to long hair on top and a fade haircut, combing your hair to one side can give the illusion of more volume.\nWhen styling a comb over, the goal is to use a small amount of light product, comb your hair back and to one side, and not make it obvious you are trying to hide bald spots. The brushed hair should be subtle and airy, not flat with thick clumps. Use a wide-tooth comb with a light touch."

Lightly comb your hair towards your face and leave the top messy while the front hangs over your forehead. Guys with longer hair in the front can even style a fringe to hide balding areas."

For deeply receding hair, we recommend keeping things short. Start with a high fade or undercut on the sides to limit contrast and make the thin hair on top look thicker.\nAfter applying some men\u2019s hair product, slick your hair towards the back of your head with a brush or comb. As you comb back, make sure to lift to add volume."

This also avoids your waves getting messed up at night, thereby destroying all the progress you made from brushing.\nIf your hair is perfect for waves, you can make your straight hair wavy overnight. Otherwise, repeat this process consistently to get 360 waves. Straight hair wavers should start to see progress within a few days!"

        "Description": "The widow\u2019s peak comb over is a practical hairstyle that allows you to cover up one side of your hairline. By combing your hair to the side and hiding a part of your widow\u2019s peak, guys can take away attention and focus the eyes on the attractive hairstyle on top. If you have thick hair, we highly suggest getting the messy comb over fade."

        "Description": "The undercut is another barbershop favorite that looks good with a variety of men\u2019s haircuts. Undercut hairstyles work with a widow\u2019s peak by making the hair on top appear to be fuller in comparison. And because the undercut is generally cut very high and short, it can stop people from noticing your hairline. The best part is that guys have so many choices here, from the slicked back undercut to a comb over, pomp or quiff."

The side part haircut is classy and timeless, but when combined with a thick hard part that accentuates the combing over of the hair, the style takes on a new look. Whether you have a widow\u2019s peak or not, you\u2019ll love side parted hair with a line shaved into your scalp."

        "Description": "Viking braids offer a stylish way to create a unique look. Guys can braid hair of all lengths, deciding to simply intertwine a few strands or all of their hair. Similarly, how you braid your hair and what type of hairstyle you get braided can make all the difference.\nFor example, a braided part can work nicely for a modern gentleman with a pompadour fade, comb over or slicked back undercut.\nOn the other hand, guys can loosely braid their top knot or man ponytail. Even a braided mohawk bun can look good on the right dude. Just imagine braids on top with shaved sides and back, and you have one badass look.\nUltimately, if you have the right hair length, cut and style, the men\u2019s Viking braids may be a sexy hairstyle to experiment with."

        "Description": "The Viking mohawk is another classic Nordic warrior hairstyle that was used to evoke fear into enemies. With shaved back and sides, a long mohawk will stand out and emphasize the strip of hair in the middle.\nFor an even more aggressive finish, grow a long braided beard or a long ponytail in the back and you have the makings of a savage yet trendy style."

        "Nom": "Viking Undercut",
        "Description": "If you\u2019re looking for a popular haircut that is both Viking and hipster, look no further than the undercut. The Viking undercut pairs with all types of cuts and styles, and is part of the short sides, long top hairstyle trend of recent years. For instance, you can combine a top knot, ponytail, or slicked back hair with an undercut.\nIn addition to being easy to style, undercut hairstyles offer a ton of contrast. If you don\u2019t want to shave your head, the next closest option is a Viking undercut or fade."

        "Nom": "Long Hair and Beard",
        "Description": "If you have long, lustrous hair, then skip the shaved head and get a long hairstyle with a beard. While long hair doesn\u2019t always come across as manly, a thick beard style can offer a tough, manly look. It also helps if you add a messy, textured finish using sea salt spray or clay.\nPlus, having a lot of hair to work with allows for a variety of Viking styles. From a ponytail to a man bun to a braided top knot, guys can change their look when they have the length to make it happen."

Proper care becomes essential with longer hair, so a good shampoo and conditioner is necessary to grow out your hair and keep it healthy.\nEven when growing your hair long, guys will want to get a regular haircut every couple of months just to trim split-ends and maintain their style.\nWhen styling, apply a light hold mousse, clay, or wax to minimize frizz and get nice movement. A medium to high hold product may be useful for a more controlled approach that will keep your hairstyle in place all day."

By brushing back the thick hair in the front and middle of your head, guys can create a flowing look that prevents loose or messy strands from sticking out and appearing uncouth. A slick back is brilliant if you suffer from cowlicks. Guys will need to use a strong pomade or mousse to create the shine that is synonymous with the slick back. Moreover, it\u2019s best to style with a comb rather than your fingers. Men with fine hair may require a thickening product like wax or clay for a naturally textured finish that will make the hairstyle look fuller and thicker."

        "Description": "The ponytail is a low-maintenance hairstyle for guys who want an effortlessly chic look. Although it\u2019s been overshadowed by the man bun in recent years, a ponytail is still a fantastic option when men want a trendy aesthetic without too much styling. Aside from pulling your hair back, you should focus on adding shine to avoid looking ungainly. Brushing it thoroughly is a tried and tested method, but you can add a splash of liquid to moisturize the follicles and eliminate frizz for a smooth style. If a ponytail gets boring, consider switching the angle from a low position to a high one, or vice versa, and incorporate a new dimension. For inspiration, you should follow Chris Hemsworth\u2019s ponytail game because it\u2019s on-point when he\u2019s on the go."

As you can tell from these examples, long waves are flexible and versatile, allowing you to style a sexy yet manly look. The modern version incorporates a pompadour into the mix to offset the fluidity, which you can achieve by blow-drying your fringe up and back, then letting it dry naturally. However, if you only want to focus on defining your kinks, the trick is to avoid brushing. Instead, you need to highlight your natural waves by applying hair product and scrunching up your hair for added definition. A mousse or spray with sea salt will give you the texturized, surfer aesthetic that guys after a day at the beach."

Man bun styles have become more iconic with time as long hair men appreciate its stylish and functional design. This look is versatile enough to wear as a professional in and out of the office, which is a bonus as overgrown locks can appear wild and cluttered. As a rule, your man ban should reflect the laid back and relaxed nature of your hairstyle, but a formal and refined styling can look classy in more formal settings. With that in mind, a smart move is to position the bun just below the crown and loosen it a little so that it too high and tight. Another cool tip is to let strands from your tied-up hair poke out from the bun to cement the casual appeal."

Whether the part is at the side or down the middle of your head, the different proportions ensure that your cut is visually striking. But, this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s hard or sharp. Like all great longer hairstyles, a part lets you keep the soft vibe men find refreshing. For a side part, you can train your hair to stay in place by tucking the sides behind your ear after sweeping it over. Hairspray can assist if your overgrown sides are impossible to maintain. If you want to do a center part, you need to draw a line down the middle of your head after washing your hair to create a border and move everything to either side. Beards are always nice, but no facial hair keeps it youthful and clean-cut."

While stands hang loose and drop-down, he also has a man bun or small ponytail that lifts part of this style upwards. In many ways, this trend is bold and edgy since it\u2019s tough to get right, and you must be confident even if you nail it the first time. On the flip side, it\u2019s chic and cool as it mixes the relaxed nature of long hair with the low-maintenance appeal of tying up your hair. To obtain this cut, you need to pull around one-third of your hair back from the middle section, before securing it in a loose bun or ponytail. You can incorporate more texture by layering the top hair that remains or not washing it for a day or two."

If you fancy attempting something more daring, you can braid your hair along the top and sides of your head and tie the remaining strands into a thick bun. The contrast from this look is very eye-catching as the fullness of the bun works nicely with the sleek, minimal style of the plaits. A ponytail is just as effective as a man bun, and its loose nature means you can appear fashionably casual."

Although lots of men try to curb them, there isn\u2019t a better way to create an originally attention-grabbing style than letting them grow out. Aside from the length, the texture and thickness of the curls are visually striking, while they also flatter softer facial features. You should beware that long curls require plenty of maintenance work as you don\u2019t want them to appear frizzy and untamed. Instead, you want smoothness twinned with their natural bounce. To do this, it\u2019s vital that you condition your hair regularly, and use hair products that contain moisture. The last point is critical because it\u2019s easy to texturize your curls and remove the natural water and oil, so make sure you read the packaging before heading to the checkout."

Dreadlocks is a one-of-a-kind style, making them perfect for guys who like an edgy cut. Another reason you\u2019ll love dreads is that they work well with different styles. You can wear them in a man bun, sweep them to the side with a part, or use a fade or undercut to incorporate a fresh contrast. Remember that texture is the core principle of dreadlocks as the grainy, frizzy consistency upgrades long hair that\u2019s dull."

The key is to choose the right beard length and style to complement your aesthetic and always keep your facial hair groomed and maintained.

        "Nom": "Straight Hair",
        "Description": "Straight hair is one of the most common hair types for men, making it easy to distinguish and the extremely versatile. Also known as type 1, straight hair has no visible curl pattern and grows straight from the root. Not all men\u2019s hair is equally straight and some guys discover minor curling when their strands grow out longer. Straight hair is strong, resilient, and tends to hold up well against humidity and inclement weather.\nGuys with straight hair may find that their scalp is oily and requires regular washing. This constant oil secretion gives straight hair a soft and sleek texture. Excessive oil can make hair look flat and lifeless, so establishing a styling and maintenance routine is wise.\nThere are three types of straight hair called 1A, 1B and 1C.\nTo maintain straight hair, you\u2019ll want to wash it once a day with a quality shampoo to remove buildup. If you\u2019re struggling for time, dry shampoo is a great alternative that can minimize that greasy look. While you may be tempted to skip conditioner when you have oily hair, small amounts of thickening conditioner can keep your hair moisturized, healthy and soft.\nOver-conditioning hair will make hair look flat and excessively greasy, so stick to twice a week. Since dandruff is a common health issue, you\u2019ll want to regularly check for white flakes and dryness. A good anti-dandruff shampoo can prevent dry skin on the scalp.\nStyling straight hair is easy since guys can choose from all the most popular men\u2019s hairstyles. As this hair type is quite pliable, it works well in slicked back and layered styles. To counter flatness, use a lightweight styling cream with a low-gloss finish. These products will add lift and volume without grease. As straight locks get oily quickly, thick and creamy styling products should be avoided. Not only will these add unnecessary weight to straight hair, but they accelerate oil production.\nFor styles that require a stronger hold, use a clay or putty hair product for a textured and thicker look. Men who love low-maintenance hairstyles should invest in a sea salt spray. Light tousling will add texture and volume to straight hair with little effort."

Wavy-haired guys won\u2019t experience oil buildup, but they may experience frizz, which can be managed with high-quality hair products. Wavy hair can be straightened or styled into many different men\u2019s hairstyles, including the quiff, side part and messy look.\nThere are three types of curly hair called 2A, 2B and 2C.\nTo maintain wavy hair, you\u2019ll want to use a good shampoo and conditioner to strengthen your locks and keep frizz under control. A moisturizing shampoo containing argan and jojoba oils will keep your scalp and strands clean, healthy and hydrated.\nAlthough wavy hair can take more regular conditioning than straight hair, men with this hair type should choose a lighter conditioner to prevent the ingredients from weighing down their style.\nWhen styling wavy hair, make sure to take advantage of your texture and volume for a fashionable look. A leave-in conditioner can be a great way to tame flyaways, retain moisturize, and maintain a smooth and soft look.\nTo keep strands in place, grab a styling cream or pomade. These hair products add definition to hair and prevent kinks. If you have long wavy hair, it\u2019s worth purchasing a diffuser. Although not strictly necessary, diffusers add balanced volume to wavy hair when drying."

        "Description": "Curly hair is defined by noticeable curls and kinks in the hair. Also known as type 3, curly hair types are defined than wavy kinds but not as tight as coiled hair. Curls are usually thick, fragile and aggravated by humidity. This hair type requires more care and maintenance than others since it needs constant moisture to look healthy. Curly hair can be loose and lean towards a wave shape or take on a much tighter ringlet pattern.\nYou can have three different types of curly hair called 3A, 3B and 3C.\nThe trick to maintaining curly hair is keeping it packed full of moisture. Hair oils and serums that provide a glossy finish look incredible on curly hair, as they prevent frizz and make hair look healthier. Curly hair can often look dull, so spritzing a shine spray onto curls is also effective. When washing and conditioning, keep the water temperature low. High levels of heat and moisture are a recipe for frizz and should be avoided.\nThe most important maintenance tip for curly hair is to avoid brushing it. The friction created by brushing quickly makes curly hair look bushy and unkempt. To keep curls defined, use a wide-toothed comb while your hair is still damp to gently separate curls. A leave-in conditioner and some gentle scrunching will also add depth to your style and allow your curly hair products to be distributed evenly.\nTo style curly hair, use a simple cream that won\u2019t weigh curls down. To get the perfect hairstyle, try short choppy curls for a low-maintenance look or a heavy angular fringe for an edgy vibe. Some guys may want to experiment with cool messy styles by letting their curly hair fall naturally. When styling, just don\u2019t straighten your curls out since this is a time-consuming process and can damage your hair, resulting in unmanageable frizz."

        "Titre": "Different Hair Types For Men",
        "Nom": "Coily Hair",
        "Description": "Many people think that coily hair is just curly hair, but this type is unique and different. Also known as kinky or type 4, this texture is very tightly curled and is commonly found in Afro-textured hair. While black men can have a few different hair types, including curly, wavy and kinky hair, the most common texture is coily hair. These coils have a dense texture and are extremely fragile because natural oils from the scalp are unable to travel to the ends efficiently, leaving the hair brittle and lacking in moisture.\nDeep conditioning and careful drying are a must when dealing with coily hair; otherwise, you can easily end up with frizzy hair that will be a challenge to style. When styled properly, coily hair can be incredibly eye-catching and stylish.\nThese are the differences between the types of coily hair:\nTo maintain this type, invest in high-quality hair products that will maintain moisture in your roots and strands. Gentle, sulfate-free shampoos paired with a deep conditioning treatment will keep dryness at bay and help you avoid damage. Although those with curls may manage without a diffuser, this attachment can be a lifesaver for coily-haired men. The diffuser helps to reduce frizz and will quickly dry your hair when you need to leave the house in a hurry. Above all, keep your hair away from extreme heat since these tight coils react poorly to it.\nCoily hair can be tricky to style, but the right products and grooming routine will set you up for success. You want to avoid tugging and pulling coiled hair, so brushing is out of the question. Due to its natural shape, coiled hair looks wonderful when prepared with natural oils like coconut or jojoba and kept at shoulder length. For a manageable style, choose a very short to medium short hairstyle with volume."

        "Nom": "Thin Hair",
        "Description": "If you have thin hair, you\u2019ll be able to see your scalp without much difficulty. Guys with thinner hair will have fewer and thinner strands than those with thicker hair. This hair type is naturally silky and lightweight but is prone to split ends and breakage. Not everyone with thin hair was born with it. Unfortunately, older men are prone to thinning hair. These guys are in good company since most men experience some thinning or balding in their later years.\nTo maintain thin hair, wash it regularly with a gentle volumizing shampoo that is free of sulfates. Keratin and biotin are beneficial ingredients that can protect and revitalize thin hair, even offering a degree of regrowth. Thin hair can feel greasy if not washed regularly but should still be conditioned a couple of times a week to maintain moisture levels and prevent further damage.\nTo style thin hair, start by creating volume for a thicker appearance. You\u2019ll need to use textured hair products like pomades and clays that won\u2019t weigh your hair down and leave it flat and dull. Some guys may apply a pre-styler and a light-hold mousse to maximize fullness and lift. You will also need to avoid hair dryers and high-heat styling options that may further damage your delicate follicles.\nWith the right haircut and styling process, thin hair guys can style a modern comb over fade, slicked back undercut or classy crew cut. With short hair on the sides and back paired with short to medium length hair on top, you can pull attention away from your thinning hair and create a fuller look."

When looking at guys with thick hair, you will not be able to see the scalp because the hair is dense and full. This hair type takes a long time to dry and tends to look more textured and voluminous than other kinds.\nTo maintain thick hair, guys should condition it regularly. This will keep hair manageable and lustrous. Those with thicker strands can afford to condition as much as they shampoo, with every other day being optimal. When you\u2019re searching for shampoos, look for products with moisturizing formulas that don\u2019t add extra volume.\nYour hair care products don\u2019t need any additional thickening agents, so hydration and cleansing are what you should focus on. As thick hair can be prone to frizz, work a deep conditioner into your routine once a week.\nThick hair looks sensational when styled as it always looks full-bodied and striking. It can be difficult to hold thick hair in place and heavy products may cause clumping. Thicker hair men should use strong styling products like pomade, gel or wax for a clean finish.\nThe best hair products will give allow you to shape and define your hairstyle while maintaining the look all day. For frizzy hair, you may want to invest in a top-rated moisturizing shampoo and condition to increase hydration, volume and natural shine."

A high bald fade will offer a strong contrast for an edgy style. On the other hand, a low taper fade might be a better option if you don\u2019t want the skin of your scalp to show. Either way, if you want a trendy but clean cut hairstyle, short dreads with a fade is your best bet."

        "Description": "As one of the best dreadlock styles to get, high top dreads, or even undercut dreads, are generally easier to manage and control. The taper fade on the back and sides keeps the hair short, while leaving a longer top. The dreads on top can then be left messy, pulled back, tied up, or styled any way you want. Ultimately, high top dreads can be cut and worn in a variety of ways, but almost all the variations are stylish and classy."

The mohawk fade with dreads on top looks best with shaved sides and short to medium length dreaded hair. The beauty of this cut is that the burst fade on the sides is easy to maintain, and the hair on top is versatile enough to be kept short or long."

        "Description": "Short dread styles for guys may not be a distinct look, but it\u2019s worth noting the benefits of shorter versus longer hair. While long dreadlock hairstyles tend to stand out more, short dreads are easier to maintain, manage and style every day. And although some men may think only long strands are versatile, there are so many styles for short locs, such as keeping them up, letting them fall to one side, parting in the middle, messy and all over, or worn into a top knot."

By bleaching or dying your dreadlocks to incorporate different colors, particularly red streaks or ashy and blonde highlights, black men can make their dreads unique. How you decide to use color in your hair can really make all the difference here. Blonde highlights at the end of long dreads can be really dope."

You\u2019ll have more styling options with thin dreads over large ones as you can create more intricate designs, but both provide a good, low-maintenance finish. If you already have dreadlocks and want to change your look, then consider any number of braided dreads hairstyles."

        "Description": "The best braided man buns for you may not be the best for someone else, so it\u2019s important that you think about your hair\u2019s texture, thickness and length when deciding which of these styles you want to try. Some work well for everyone regardless of hair type, and others are better-suited for men who have thick or wavy hair. The cool part about all of these styles is the fact that you can customize them in any way you\u2019d like, whether you want to braid in a different direction or place your bun higher or lower than what you see in the examples.\nFor instance, the side braid bun is styled on the side instead of the top of your head. Some messy hairstyles even look better with a full beard while others style perfectly with a fade or undercut on the sides to highlight the longer hair above.\nThough man bun braid hairstyles offer endless possibilities, the man buns with braids below provide plenty of choices and allow guys ample room to experiment."

        "Description": "Dutch braids are easy to do, and they can look amazing when done properly. Dutch braiding along both sides of the head before pulling your braids back into a bun \u2013 either neat or messy \u2013 will make it look like you put far more time into styling your hair than you did.\nFor reference, Dutch braids on guys are styled like an inverted French braid hairstyle; rather than taking each section of hair over the next, you will instead take each section under the one before it, resulting in a raised braid with thicker knots."

        "Description": "The double man bun is ideal for guys who have especially thick hair. To accomplish it with braids, just braid your hair all over (think cornrows or smaller Dutch braids), and then pull it up into two buns rather than one.\nIt may take some experimentation to really find the best double man bun style for your face and look, but that\u2019s the great thing about it \u2013 experimenting is fun, casual, and still classy. The double man bun also works well with a fade haircut or undercut on the sides, so be sure to ask your barber to try these cuts and see how they look."

Start with two braids \u2013 one on each side of your head \u2013 and you can do either a French braid or a Dutch braid to suit your preferences. Then, make sure the two braids meet at a central point and pull them into a bun. You can even braid the two together to make it appear even more complex.\nDoing it in this way helps prevent tangles if you have especially long hair. You can also divide your hair in half right down the middle of your head, create a braid on either side, and then pull each side up into its own messy bun."

Just start at the top of your head and French braid as per the usual, but instead of continuing to braid all the way down the length of your hair, stop when you reach the point where you want your bun to be and twist it up in a knot.\nFrench braids are essential for protecting your hair from the wind, so if you\u2019ll be out on a bike or boat, this is a good long hairstyle to choose. You can divide your hair in half and do separate French braids that meet in a singular bun at the back."

Just braid a section along the side of your head and pull it back into the bun with the rest of your hair.\nIn fact, guys can combine the side braid with any number of haircuts, including a pompadour, slick back, or messy medium length hairstyle. This braid can be thin, thick, clean, or loose \u2013 just as long as it suits the type of style you\u2019re trying to create."

        "Description": "A short man bun with braids is an excellent style for men who are in the process of growing out their hair or who simply do not want to grow it beyond shoulder length. Braids for men with short hair work best with one or more French braids close to one another. This is because French braid styles help to hide flyaways and loose strands of hair since short hair can easily be tucked under longer ones.\nWhen the braid reaches the back of your head, simply twist it up and secure it with a hair tie. You can do it with braids on top of your head, on the side, or all over. Short man buns look better when kept neat, but if your hair is long enough, you may be able to pull off the messy man bun look."

Cornrows pulled up into a bun that falls gently in different directions is all the rage, and the good news is that it\u2019s as functional as it is stylish.\nNo matter how long your hair, braiding it and putting it into a long man bun can help keep your hairstyle out of your way. Long man bun braids are also a great way to extend the time between shampoos since braided hair does not show natural oils as readily as unbraided hair."

A fade with braids offers limitless possibilities because there are so many different types of fades to choose from \u2013 high, low, mid, skin, or temp \u2013 and many different ways to style braided hair.\nAny of the braided man bun styles above will work well with a fade haircut on the sides. To pull off braids with a fade, you\u2019ll need to start with medium-length to long hair on top \u2013 at least 4 to 6 inches. You can go for a short man bun or a long braided hairstyle, and you can use French braids, Dutch braids, or cornrows.\nUltimately, the short faded hair on the sides will create contrast and accentuate the longer braided hair on top."

        "Description": "The man bun undercut with braids looks much like the taper fade cut above, but rather than a fade that gradually gets shorter as it works its way down beyond the ears toward the nape, undercut hairstyles are all one length. The braided man bun undercut offers the same contrast and focus on the hair on top, and is often paired with a thick beard for a rugged, masculine look.\nBraiding the top section of hair before putting it in a bun adds a great deal of style. Again, you get to choose the number and type of braids you want, so don\u2019t hesitate to try various looks until you find one that best suits your look. The best part about the undercut is that even when you leave your hair down, you can style a slicked back undercut or comb over.\nLastly, if you love this cool men\u2019s haircut, you may want to get shaved sides with your braided man bun for an even shorter cut."

Thick braids work best for thicker hair while thin braids are better for thinner or less coarse hair.\nIncorporating some color into your braid is a great way to show off each braid\u2019s definition. Ultimately, whether you get the cornrow fade man bun, the black man\u2019s undercut bun, or box braids, these black men\u2019s man bun braid styles are fresh, trendy and badass.

Though braids are usually woven into hair in an effort to prevent messy tangles and the like, the braided messy man bun can make quite the statement. Easy to style and maintain, messy braided hairstyles for long hair are the go-to look for guys who are too busy in the mornings or just want a casual but sexy look.\nStart with one or more braids that are clearly visible, then pull them back along with the rest of your hair into a bun. Rather than the neat perfectly-coiffed bun you might see, the goal here is to allow bits of hair or individual braids to fall free. This is a great look for men who have long wavy or thick hair."

        "Description": "Today\u2019s take on samurai hair is a distinct departure from that of true Japanese warrior hairstyles. Traditionally, samurai hair features long hair being drawn into a ponytail, except the hair on top of the scalp was shaved off. The man ponytail, after being tied up, is folded such that the additional slack rests on top of the shaved head. This piece of thick hair on top is what held the warrior\u2019s helmet centered.\nAs you might expect, the classic samurai ponytail with shaved sides all around wasn\u2019t fashionable by Western standards, and was modified to fit European and American culture. What emerged were two similar, yet distinctly branded hairstyles.\nOne style became known as the Japanese top knot, also known as the samurai top knot. This hairstyle is essentially a man bun with shaved sides. The other is the standalone man bun with a guy\u2019s long hair pulled back and tied. Both have become staple Japanese male hairstyles."

        "Titre": "Rappers with Dreads",
        "Nom": "J Cole",
        "Description": "J Cole grew up with a mother who loved rock and folk, and a father who was very into hardcore hip-hop. There\u2019s no doubt he was heavily influenced by the music he listened to during his formative years. He started expressing an affinity for rapping ever since the age of 12. Fast-forward a few decades and he\u2019s now widely regarded as one of the most influential rappers of his generation.\nOn the hair front, J Cole is pretty faithful to his dreads. With so many dreadlock styles to choose from, the rapper sometimes styles his hair in an elaborate ponytail but usually leaves them loose and flowing. Simple yet stylish, this rapper with dreads is an excellent example of free-form locs that look good."

        "Description": "New to the spotlight, Lil Pump is a prominent member of the SoundCloud rap scene. He rose to popularity with his viral song Gucci Gang in 2017 and has quickly started to build a hyperactive public persona. He made headlines for his legal troubles, endorsing Donald Trump, and his eclectic sense of style.\nIn terms of legitimacy, Lil Pump is the closest you\u2019ll get to a white rapper with dreads, although his background is technically Colombian and therefore Latino. Lil Pump likes to play around with his dreads, whether he\u2019s dying them in crazy colors or styling them in unexpected ways."

        "Description": "Also known as Tity Boi, 2Chainz entered the music scene as part of Playaz Circle, a hip hop duo he ultimately left to further his career. That turned out to be a smart move, as the rapper soon became an international success.\n2 Chainz\u2019s signature dreads have been around for a long time. They\u2019re sometimes dyed blonde. Other times they\u2019re freeform, no styling whatsoever. Whichever the case, it\u2019s clear that the rapper maintains them regularly, often sharing dreadlock updates via Instagram. If you want your dreads to look good and healthy, you\u2019ll want to take proper care of your hair."

        "Description": "With a prolific career under his belt, Busta Rhymes needs no introduction. The rapper won over the world with his ragga-inspired style and complex lyrics, heavily dominating the hip hop scene in the \u201890s and 2000s.\nBusta Rhymes has been rocking short hair for more than a decade, but at the height of his career dreadlocks were ingrained into his look. He started growing them in December \u201989 and didn\u2019t chop them off until 2005. That\u2019s 15 years of commitment, although we\u2019re guessing that paying homage to his Jamaican heritage was also one of the reasons the hairstyle lasted him that long."

        "Description": "Often cited as one of the greatest rappers of all time, Lil Wayne kicked off his career in 1995. The rapper has sold over 120 million records worldwide and has won countless awards, including five Grammys. Besides his solo projects, he also made waves thanks to his collaborations with artists like Justin Bieber, Fall Out Boy, Paris Hilton, and Ariana Grande.\nWhile his music may have changed over the years, his hair stayed mostly the same. Lil Wayne\u2019s dreadlocks made their debut around the time his album The Carter came out.\nIn recent years, there have been reports that some of the rapper\u2019s dreads are falling out due to thinning roots, which isn\u2019t surprising. Take this as a cautionary tale. Dreads require rigorous maintenance."

The rapper released his debut album back in 2006 and has been enjoying huge acclaim ever since; especially once he dropped the worldwide hit See You Again from the Furious 7 soundtrack.\nWiz Khalifa\u2019s dreads are iconic, but the rapper hasn\u2019t styled his locs in a while and doesn\u2019t seem eager to experiment with purple hair again. Still, we can\u2019t help but admire the rapper\u2019s hairstyle and fashion. He always looks on point."

There\u2019s a reason for that \u2013 the dreads suit this rapper\u2019s relaxed look perfectly."

Even with short haircuts, it\u2019s important that you ask your kid\u2019s barber to cut the hair even shorter on the sides and back. A kids fade haircut or undercut offers the necessary contrast to focus the eyes on the cool styling on the top of the head.\nFortunately, there are many different types of taper fades and undercuts, allowing parents and children to decide how edgy or clean-cut they want their trim to be.\nSimilarly, hairstyles for boys also range depending on hair type, length, and texture. From short to long, neat to messy, easy to creative, shiny to textured, and classic to modern, kids have a number of styling options to pick. The latest hair trends for kids have centered around the comb over, mohawk, spiky hair, and variations of messy, textured styles.\nSome boys like to ask their barber for a hard part or get haircut designs shaved into their sides. Truly, boys hairstyle ideas are endless opportunities to be unique and bold.\nLet\u2019s take a look at the most popular kids haircuts to get right now!"

As the most popular version of short sides, long top hairstyles, we highly recommend taper fades for kids.\nBoys can choose from several fades, including the high, mid and low fade cuts. Kids can also pick how short the cut goes. The skin or bald fade tapers hair down to the scalp for a very short and edgy look.\nWhether little boy has short, long, straight, thick, thin, wavy or curly hair, fade haircuts can take your child\u2019s hairstyle to the next level."

The undercut is one of the coolest haircut ideas for young and older boys alike.\nThe undercut features a short haircut on the sides and back that is one length. The name characterizes the cutting technique, whereby your child\u2019s barber seemingly cuts under the hair on top. Unlike the fade, undercut hairstyles are not blended or tapered.\nOften paired with a slick back, comb over, mohawk or spiked up styling, the undercut is classy and elegant yet outgoing and sleek.\nIf you need an awesome 9, 10, 11 or 12 year old boys hairstyle that will really stand out, get your kid an undercut haircut."

        "Description": "The comb over for kids is one of the most versatile and best boys haircuts to get. Specifically, the comb over fade provides the foundation to style a number of hairstyles.\nStart with undercut or faded sides and back. Parents and boys can decide on a low, mid, or high fade and then determine how short to go. The skin fade will buzz hair very short, and this can be great as a summer cut. Other ways to tailor the cut include adding a hard part or etching a hair design into the sides.\nTo do a comb over, apply a quality pomade, gel, or wax and spread it through your kid\u2019s hair. Then part the hair to one side with a brush or comb. Use a matte styling product for a natural, textured finish.\nThe comb over haircut can also be transformed to style a mohawk, quiff, pompadour, messy shag top, or long angular fringe.\nEasy to get and simple to style, the kids comb over haircut is certainly a barbershop favorite."

Casual yet adorable spiky haircuts are effortless to style and perfect for kids with layered thick, straight hair.\nWith a strong high-hold gel or pomade, run your hands through your little boys hair and lift. To create distinct individual spikes, use your fingers to shape thick groups of hair. Otherwise, leave the spiked up hair messy and textured for a fuller look. Another styling idea may be to just spike up the front.\nFor kids with thin hair, make sure you use a low or no shine styling product like wax or clay for a thicker appearance.\nUltimately, spiky hairstyles for kids are sleek and fun. Add a fade on the sides with a shaved line or shape up for a unique look that will stand out."

No longer considered a fad, man bun styles work beautifully for boys and guys who want a simple yet trendy way to rock their long hair. The man bun is similar to the top knot, but this long hairstyle is typically set farther back.\nWhile the top knot often comes with faded, undercut, or shaved sides with long hair on top that is tied up in a knot, the man bun is achieved with longer hair that is kept in a bun in the back. This hairstyle is great for kids who want to embrace their long, straight hair but want to keep it out of their face sometimes."

        "Description": "If your boy wants to try something daring, grow his hair out and go for the top knot. The top knot came onto the scene around the same time as the man bun, but hasn\u2019t enjoyed the same following. While the top knot is remarkably similar to a ponytail, the difference is the placement of the tie up and the often faded, undercut or shaved sides.\nLittle boys and teenage guys will have to grow out a lot of hair and then cut the sides short, or slowly grow just the top while maintaining the shorter sides. Once you have enough hair on top, gather it into a knot on the crown, and use a hair tie to keep it in place."

        "Nom": "Taper Fade Haircuts",
        "Description": "The boys fade haircut is the most popular way for kids to cut hair on the sides and back. Low-maintenance and easy to style, taper fades offer very short haircuts that focus the eyes on the styling on top.\nThere are many kinds of fades for little boys to choose from. Whether your kid wants a low, mid, high, or skin fade will determine where the tapering begins and how short the hair gets.\nThe low fade starts just above the ear and tapers down to the neckline. Classy and handsome, this haircut may be good for a 4, 5, 6, or 7 year old boy whose mom wants to retain some semblance of innocence.\nThe high fade starts the blending process very high on the sides and back, just below the hairstyle above. Edgy and bold, this type of fade may be the perfect short haircut for a 10 year old boy or older.\nFinally, the bald or skin fade is a haircut that blends hair down to the skin. Cool and trendy for young tween boys, this clean cut looks nice with fashionable, sleek hairstyles such as the comb over, slick back, mohawk, and spiky hair. Some kids even like to ask their barbers to shave a design or add a hard part into their cut.\nMany of the best hairstyles for kids ages 6 through 12 start with short sides and long hair on top. Taper fade haircuts provide plenty of variation and work with most hair lengths, types, and textures.\nJust make sure to get your boy a good hair product so he can style all his favorite looks. Alternatively, if you think he\u2019s grown-up enough, check out the top styling products for guys, including pomade, wax and cream."

        "Nom": "Undercut",
        "Description": "The undercut is one of the coolest haircuts for boys right now. As its name implies, an undercut involves keeping the hair on the top of the head and buzzing underneath it to shorten or remove hair on the sides and back of the head.\nThe end result is a one-length cut that looks fresh and stylish for all types of kid\u2019s hairstyles.\nAs one of the best 9, 10, 11 and 12 year old boy haircuts you can get, the undercut has limitless styling options. Like the fade, it works with all hair lengths and can be styled with slick back, comb over, pompadour, quiff, spiky, and messy styles.\nWhile boys with thick hair pull off the undercut best, the look can work with a variety of types. Talk to your child\u2019s barber to see if the cut is right for your kid\u2019s look."

Compatible with long, medium, and short hair, spiked up hairstyles can be worn in a slew of ways to pull off vastly different looks.\nFor instance, short spiky hair looks best when textured on top to create a naturally messy look.\nWhen combined with a high taper fade, short thick spikes draw the eyes to the awesome styling on top of the head.\nMedium to long haired boys can choose to spike their hair in the front, style thick spikes all over, or to combine the style with a faux hawk.\nA great spiky haircut can really transform your kid\u2019s style and looks flattering on a 8 or 11 year old boy."

        "Description": "Daring and adorable, the mohawk is an exceptional hairstyle for self-expression. While it allows young boys to feel rebellious, wild and crazy, mohawk styles are incredibly versatile depending on how extreme of a cut you let your child try.\nFrom shaved sides to short taper fade cuts, the length of hair on the sides and back of the head will influence the overall look. For instance, a mohawk with shaved sides is much more outgoing and unique than a sleek faux hawk fade.\nNevertheless, how short or long you keep your hair on top will is really what will affect the styling of your mohawk. Regardless of whether your little boy chooses a long or short mohawk, he will need a strong gel or pomade to keep the hair up.\nKids mohawk and faux hawk haircuts work for all hair types, including fine, thick, and curly hair.\nJust to note, if your child is looking for the best back to school haircuts and wants something to stand out, we recommend you start with the faux hawk and fade."

While the pompadour hairstyle was made famous by celebrities such as Elvis Presley and James Dean, the modern pompadour is less structured and more fluid with good volume and flow. However, nothing beats the casual and effortless look of the modern quiff.\nSince the styling of each requires creating volume at the front of the head, it\u2019s no surprise that the pompadour and quiff are easily confused.\nThe difference between the quiff and pompadour is that the famous pomp is brushed up and back to achieve a sleek, rock star look. It requires a good hair product and some effort.\nOn the other hand, the quiff flows beautifully as it is brushed up and forward to create an airy volume that is equal parts attitude and functionality.\nAs very cool hairstyles for 10, 11 and 12 year olds, these haircuts are better-suited for older kids."

After all, this is the ideal time in life for him to experiment with different looks, so embrace the shag haircut and forget about the upkeep that comes with other short, medium and long styles.\nThe good news is that messy doesn\u2019t have to mean unkempt or dirty. In fact, when styled correctly, these simple hairstyles can be quite handsome and chic, especially for unruly coarse hair and hard-to-manage curls.\nThe secret to wearing a nice shaggy or messy hairstyle is to add layers to the hair and style it with a light hold cream. In addition to creating volume and texture, the styling cream will maximize control while moisturizing and conditioning to minimize frizz.\nShort messy hair continues to be a hot trends, but the curly hair fringe is a trendy idea as well."

The sides can be faded in different ways, with the favorite being a high skin fade. This creates a strong contrast that emphasizes the hairstyle on top.\nTo get a cool quiff, use pomade or wax that has little to no shine and spread it through with your hands. Now run your fingers through your little boy\u2019s hair, lifting while brushing his hair back. Leave the hair naturally textured and loose for a relaxed, slightly messy style."

These types of little boy mohawk styles leave enough length for versatility, allowing kids to style a number of different hairstyles."

As one of the best hairstyles for boys with thick hair, this short faux hawk is worth trying!\nThis long faux hawk fade looks daring and awesome. The sides are buzzed short with a bald undercut fade that blends into the skin. The 3 stripes lines shaved into the side of the head make for an amazing hair design. And the faux hawk is styled with thick, long, distinct spikes. Altogether, this fake mohawk with long hair is incredibly stylish.\nUltimately, the boys fohawk is super versatile and can be cut and styled in a variety of ways. If you want your little boy\u2019s hair to unique and fresh without going with a full mohawk fade, then a kids faux hawk haircut won\u2019t disappoint."

Whether you get a long or short shaved mohawk will determine how outgoing the haircut will be.\nAlthough there are several types of mohawks for boys to get, it\u2019s hard to deny that the sharp spikes and crisp hairline make for a clean-cut, adorable style. To shave a mohawk at home, use good clippers with no guard and cut your little boy\u2019s hair. Cutting your kid\u2019s hair at home can save parents a ton of money on visits to the barbershop.\nPictured is a great example of a mohawk for boys with fine hair. This narrow mohawk features a very short haircut on the sides and back with dyed hair on top. Because mohawk styles are meant to be fun, kids can experiment with different styling. For instance, not all the hair needs to be spiked straight up. Apply a light styling product for a balance of height and movement.\nIn contrast, this long mohawk haircut goes the traditional route. By shaving the sides bald and spiking long hair into a narrow mohawk, this little guy is fully-committed to the look. Boys may even get inspired to dye their hair a radical color. From blue to red, green, and purple, try a temporary hair color spray or wax that washes out."

The burst skin fade is cut very short to maximize contrast, and the long curly hair is dyed blonde for a unique style. While it may take some time to grow your child\u2019s hair out this long, the result is worth it."

Spike and push the hairs towards the middle of the head or just spike up the front with an organic baby hair gel.\nAlternatively, this toddler mohawk haircut works well with a short cut.

This classic goatee features a mustache and is often just a simple circle of facial hair around the chin. This fresh and eye-catching style offers half an inch to an inch in length, making it easy to grow and simple to trim with a beard trimmer. If you want something textured but sharp, keeping the length to a light stubble will outline your bone structure but give you a rugged alternative to being clean-shaven. For more contrast, keep stubble on the jawline but clean up any areas around the neck and the cheeks for a dapper finish."

You can leave the hair untrimmed for a slightly undone and youthful vibe or keep it neatly groomed along the sides for definition. You can certainly grow your beard past the chin, but if it passes the Adam\u2019s Apple it might start to veer into Viking territory."

        "Description": "The full goatee beard is the most recognizable style and connects a circular chin beard with a soul patch and a mustache for a fashionable and bold look. This style works well on square faces as the fullness around the chin draws attention to sharp cheekbones and precise facial lines. If you have a rectangular face, experiment with shorter lengths to highlight angles and add balance to your features. The full goatee typically has straighter edges than a circle beard, and it stops around the edges of the mouth for a sleek and trendy result. To maintain your beard, pull out your trimmers around once a week to keep your look fresh and remove any dead hair that might encourage patchiness."

To showcase your signature style, fashion your tuft of hair into a wide and rounded shape or go for a teardrop shape to elongate the face."

        "Nom": "Goatee and Mustache",
        "Description": "A goatee and mustache is a modern beard style that can be easy to maintain for guys. The slight disconnect between the mustache and the goatee creates interest and texture on the face, giving guys the chance to stand out from the crowd with minimal effort. To achieve this look, grab your clippers and start by carving out the classic goatee shape at the chin using light strokes. You\u2019ll want to keep the cheeks completely clean-shaven for maximum contrast and dimension. Your mustache should be well-groomed for a dapper appearance, but you can channel your inner wild child with stray hairs around the upper lip or a badass soul patch."

        "Description": "The Van Dyke beard offers guys the chance to rock a regal and classy style that will instantly lift any outfit. Although it requires upkeep because of the signature T-shape and handlebar mustache, the historic and sexy appearance of this beard is worth the effort. The goatee beard doesn\u2019t usually connect with the rest of your facial hair and there is a strong focus on the mustache which can be worn straight or grown out and twirled upward. To make your mustache even more impressive, ask your barber to fashion your beard into a subtle teardrop shape and shorten it slightly. The soul patch should also be grown out to match the thickness of the chin beard while the rest of the face is left clean-shaven."

        "Nom": "Goatee without Mustache",
        "Description": "A goatee without a mustache is a cool facial hair style goatee that will draw attention to your jawline and features. This style is perfect for guys who want a low-maintenance style that can be trimmed every week, as mustaches often require regular trimming to avoid irritating the upper lip. If you want to create the illusion of a striking jawline on a round face, pair your goatee with a chinstrap beard with defined upper lines across the cheekbones. For the ultimate low-effort look, opt for an untrimmed goatee for a bohemian and relaxed feel or a playful chin puff."

        "Nom": "Thin Goatee",
        "Description": "The thin goatee was all the rage back in the 1950s, but this carefully manicured style is having a serious resurgence among modern men. It\u2019s an excellent option for guys who struggle with patchy facial hair or struggle to grow thick beards as it focuses on interesting lines rather than thickness. Pencil-thin goatees are extremely popular as they circle the mouth and create a sharp look that is effortlessly sleek and defined. This style is also a great choice for men with triangular faces, as the joined lines and sharp edges balance the face without overwhelming it. Although you can style a thin goatee at home, you should head to the barber shop for more precise trimming."

        "Nom": "Disconnected Goatee",
        "Description": "The disconnected goatee is a fashionable beard style that features hair on the chin and lip without connecting. The disconnected look can be a simple way to shape a goatee when you have patchy hair along the jawline and sides of the mouth. You can throw in stubble around the cheeks for an undone and rugged feel but taming your facial hair into a square-shaped beard with a subtle soul patch looks more elegant. The beauty of this style is that it flatters all face shapes. Round faces can opt for a wider style, while square and angular faces can taper their beard for a chic and refined finish."

        "Nom": "Balbo Beard",
        "Description": "The Balbo beard is a style without sideburns that includes a carefully trimmed mustache and a chin strap that extends across the jawline. It requires decent volume to look attractive, and you can pair it with a handlebar, pyramid or slim mustache depending on your personal preference. It\u2019s an excellent pick for round and square face shapes, as the fullness around the chin creates the illusion of angular features. This pulls the face down slightly to balance and streamline your look. To create attractive contrast and dimension, keep the sides of your face well-groomed and your cheeks and neck clean-shaven."

        "Description": "The circle beard is a handsome and classic look that you can easily maintain with an electric shaver. It is characterized by a mustache and a simple chin beard that are joined together in a circular shape. To highlight this connection, keep the hair closely trimmed around the neck and the cheeks. You can wear this beard short for a lightly textured look or keep it long for an edgy biker feel that shows you\u2019re not to be messed with. It adds attractive structure to the face, but this goatee doesn\u2019t add bulky volume that distracts from your features. To maintain the health of your style, work a beard oil or balm through your strands for a light shine."

        "Description": "Also known as a landing strip, a chin puff is a beard style that can be created by shaving your mustache and beard but leaving a thick line of hair directly below the center of your mouth. The landing strip must be smaller than the width of the mouth and extend to the bottom of the chin. You can grow your puff into a teardrop or diamond shape for a showstopping finish or keep your appearance modern with a small volume of hair that\u2019s uniformly trimmed along the bottom. Although it\u2019s a suitable style for most guys, it\u2019s an incredible choice for men with coarse or natural hair who struggle to tame longer beards into submission."

        "Nom": "Anchor Beard",
        "Description": "The anchor beard is a playful and youthful style that can look similar to the Van Dyke beard. True to its name, this goatee is designed to look like an anchor with a wider beard, a shorter mustache and a strip of hair that draws towards the upper lip. The angular shape creates exceptional sharpness along the jawline and adds volume without the maintenance of a chin strap or full beard. Whether you want to emulate Christian Bale or Tony Stark, you only need to grow a couple of weeks\u2019 worth of stubble to make the magic happen."

        "Description": "If you\u2019re lucky enough to grow a long beard, you can braid your facial hair in many ways, including a single long braid, two woven strands, a ponytail with a tie and twisted beard hair. While some guys like plaiting the entire beard, others prefer small braids and designs throughout with beads, rings, or colorful strings.\nMaintaining a long braided beard can be a challenge, but the style is worth it. You\u2019ll need good beard care products to make sure your facial hair stays healthy, straight, and neat. We recommend you consistently use beard oils and balms to nourish and encourage growth. Guys will also want to undo their braids and untangle their hairs every once in awhile."

As long as you have a few inches to work with and good hand-eye coordination, you can braid a short beard. Whether you want a beard bun, ponytail, wizard twirl, or classic Viking aesthetic, guys with short beards are well suited.\nThese styles can be easy to achieve and can keep your beard well-groomed. As long as you have thick or full facial hair to make at least a couple of weaves, you can opt for a very short braid. Tighten it well and you\u2019ll be graciously accepting compliments in no time."

Back in the day, the Vikings used to braid their beards to keep their facial hair from getting in the way during battle. In recent years, Viking beard braid styles are worn by confident alpha males who want to show off their cool facial hair.\nVersatile and effortlessly stylish, Viking beards fit men of all face shapes and hairstyles, but the style can be complementary to a top knot, ponytail or man bun. While the most popular version comes with tight braids and beards or rubber bands at the end, we recommend you watch the popular TV show Vikings for inspiration. Ragnar\u2019s facial hair is always fresh and on-trend."

Repeat this step with both sections of hair until you reach the desired length."

        "Description": "Also commonly known as a light stubble beard, the term scruff refers to just a couple days\u2019 worth of growth. The stubble beard is a short style any guy can grow and wear because it\u2019s almost as if you\u2019ve forgotten to shave for a day or two. Nevertheless, scruff can be used to describe any full beard that is trimmed very close to the skin. Stubble beard trimmers were specifically designed to help guys get this masculine, gritty facial hair look.\nTo get scruffy beard styles at home, just let your hair grow for several days, then use a good trimmer at low setting to keep your facial hair one length. You can let everything grow \u2013 including your neck and cheeks \u2013 or you can trim and shape your stubble in these areas for a more clean-cut finish."

Heavy stubble beards are longer than scruff so they take about 10 days to grow, but women find them to be one of the hottest facial hair styles for men. Thick stubble that is three to four millimeters long is ideal, and this cut is best for guys who grow even beards all over without patches.\nStubble beards are easy to maintain with a high-quality trimmer, and like scruff, you get to decide whether to keep your neck and cheeks clean-shaven or just let them grow. As a badass look for most men, we highly recommend heavy stubble beard styles."

The corporate beard style gets its name from the well-coiffed and trimmed look that is suitable for daily wear at the office. It\u2019s ideal for professional men who want to have a thick beard and don\u2019t mind good beard care and grooming.\nIf you\u2019re starting with a bare face, expect it to take you a few weeks (or perhaps months, if your beard grows more slowly) to reach this length. You will need to carefully maintain this short beard by trimming your cheeks, neck, and any longer hairs that may grow out from time to time. A fresh, clean presentation is of the utmost importance, and crisp lines and proper shaping is required. Invest in a top-rated beard trimmer for smooth, close cuts."

However, men can grow and groom a number of different short beards.\nGuys can grow their facial hair out, with the hair on your chin slightly longer than the hair on your cheeks. Furthermore, you can keep your neck and cheeks trimmed or let them grow naturally.\u00a0From the short full beard to the Van Dyke to thick stubble with defined lines, the short beard is classy, understated, and stylish."

There are many ways to grow and style the best long beards.\nThe trick to really rocking this look involves keeping your beard clean, smooth, soft and healthy. This means washing, shampooing, and conditioning your beard regularly as well as using beard oil and balm to keep your facial hair hydrated and conditioned all day.\nThen, as it grows thicker and longer, you will need to use a natural boar bristle beard brush to straighten your beard and maintain the styling. Alternatively, some guys prefer beard straighteners for thick, coarse facial hair."

Though you should absolutely get rid of split ends and flyaways as you see them, the yeard requires uninterrupted growth and you should not actually trim the beard for at least 12 months or longer.\nJust keep things clean, healthy, and conditioned. This means using a deep-cleansing beard shampoo and conditioner to remove dirt, grime and bacteria while moisturizing and conditioning your skin and hair. Afterwards, guys should apply beard oil with a comb that will reach their skin. This process will stop beard itch, get rid of dandruff, hydrate the skin underneath, and maximize growth."

        "Nom": "Hollywoodian",
        "Description": "The Hollywoodian is a cool, chic beard style that\u2019s been grown by a number of celebrities in the recent years. If you have prominent cheekbones that you want to show off, the Hollywoodian is a fantastic way to do it. It consists of two to three months of facial hair growth, and requires that you let your beard grow out all over and then completely shave the sideburns.\nThe Hollywoodian beard focuses your facial hair along your jawline, chin and mouth. The look may not work well with all face shapes, but it is worth experimenting to see."

        "Description": "The chin strap beard is a thin strip of facial hair that connects the sideburns to your chin. Chin strap beard styles may include a mustache or soul patch; that choice is yours to make. Essentially, when the chin strap beard is groomed and trimmed properly, it looks much like a strap that goes all the way around your head and down under your chin.\nThe strip can be thick or thin depending on how much hair you have. Ultimately, the chin strap is a good look for men who struggle to grow a full beard."

        "Nom": "Mutton Chops",
        "Description": "Mutton chops, also known as the wolverine beard, are among the most iconic beard types. To better understand how the mutton chops beard looks, imagine growing a full beard from ears to chin, then shaving the area where a goatee would normally grow \u2013 essentially like a reverse goatee. This means getting rid of the small patch of hair on your chin and above your lips where a mustache would be.\nHowever, there is the option of getting a version of this classic look \u2013 the friendly mutton chops. The friendly mutton chops beard style keeps the mustache and shaves the middle of the chin area. While you can have a mustache with your mutton chops, most men prefer to keep this part of their face perfectly bare to emulate the wolverine beard style. Mutton chops can be thin and sparse or thick and full, so don\u2019t be afraid to experiment with different styles until you find the one that best suits you. Needless to say, the wolverine beard is pretty badass and manly."

This makes for a number of possibilities when it comes to chin strap beard styles. In general, cutting a narrow strip with short facial hair makes for a more youthful look, while trimming a thick strip with long hair adds masculinity.\nIf the chin strap beard is a style you\u2019re considering, then be sure to check out some inspiration below. We made sure to include different styles, including the chinstrap goatee and mustache options!"

To start, think about how long you want your mustache to grow since the length of your facial hair will determine what styles you can get.\nFor example, men can combine it with a clean-shaven face for a modern style with Latin American roots. Another option would be to trim a Mexican style mustache with a thick beard and/or sideburns for a truly manly, almost outback look.\nNeedless to say, there\u2019s a Mexican beard somewhere out there for you, so why not take a look at some of our favorites styles!"

A close-cut style you can achieve at home with clippers, this classic buzz cut haircut will accentuate your masculine facial features and exude confidence. Plus, the uniform length means it\u2019s incredibly low-maintenance, to the point where you can roll out of bed and throw on a shirt or suit without having to worry about bed head or cowlicks. For a shorter haircut, ask your barber for a buzz cut fade that tapers the sides and back for a universally-flattering look."

        "Description": "Brad Pitt has proved that a buzz cut is a versatile trend with plenty of options for modern men. His Mr. and Mrs. Smith buzz cut has extra growth, which is perfect for men whose hairlines are full and thick.\nBut, if yours is receding a little, buzzing your head with a number one blade will take the emphasis away from the front of your hair. It\u2019s even less maintenance than a traditional buzz cut, and you can switch up your style with bleach if it gets tiresome. Don\u2019t forget about a beard for extra texture and volume."

The actor\u2019s crew cut hairstyle is a brilliant middle ground for men that want to follow his superstar trends, yet can\u2019t commit to growing long or medium-length hair.\nWith a high undercut on the back and sides, you\u2019ll always be ready for the office, and you won\u2019t appear out of place at a bar or an outside-of-work function. You don\u2019t have to use hair products if you prefer the neat and tidy look, or you can add wax for a textured aesthetic that\u2019s a little messier yet still polished."

        "Description": "Slicked back hair is an iconic style that is notorious with Wall Street bankers and power players. Nevertheless, Brad Pitt has given it a less aggressive appeal over the years by laying off the gel. Instead, he uses a small amount of styling product to ensure the slick back is less prominent, making it more sophisticated.\nThis makes it an incredibly trendy look for older men as the low slick isn\u2019t too modern and works well with silver or graying hair. Nevertheless, if you\u2019re a teen boy or a young man, a cool slicked back undercut is super edgy and trendy these days."

The good news is that you don\u2019t have to try the disconnected undercut with a slick back if you think it\u2019s too daring. An alternative is Pitt\u2019s classic but trendy crew cut with an undercut on the sides is a great way to make your hair appear thicker and full of volume. Another option is pairing a tapered undercut with a pompadour for the perfect in-between cut."

        "Description": "A fade haircut is a flattering way to wear your hair without going over the top or trying anything too daring. The fade should get gradually shorter as it makes its way towards your ears and neckline, whereas your top hair is better longer. This gives you more stylish options, such as a quiff or textured locks. A modern choice is to combine a fade with a taper before incorporating a soft side part that\u2019s handsome thanks to its sleek and timeless nature."

A ponytail is fashionable, especially when it\u2019s low, and it\u2019s super low-maintenance for busy guys who have no time for washing and styling. Should your ponytail lack a cutting edge, you can mix it up with a man bun. A man bun isn\u2019t as masculine, but its height brings a new dimension to your style."

With long front and middle hair, you get to optimize a statement quiff that instantly catches the eye, while tapered sides are clean and concise with extra contrast. The pompadour is a classic hairstyle, and it\u2019s still around today because it works well with all hair types. Either add height to the fringe or highlights to the rest of your hair for a striking visual."

        "Description": "Like Brad, your beard should complement your cut of choice. When your hair is shorter, a fuller beard provides much-needed volume and takes focus away from your hairline. However, longer hair is a better match for designer stubble as a thick beard can make you appear ungainly.\nOf course, your facial hair is dictated by your genetic ability to grow a beard. If yours is patchy or fine, you might want to grow a full mustache without a beard on your cheeks."

Also, Brad tends to utilize a soul patch to bring more proportions to the party. If you do prefer a goatee over a beard, you have to shave the rest of your face regularly to ensure one doesn\u2019t morph into the other."

From the middle part to the long bro flow, Brad Pitt\u2019s hairstyles will continue to be trendy and sexy."

For the Gosling look, the trick is to ask your barber to remove the ends from your hair so that it has more texture. The backs and sides need fading in seamlessly, and for the ultimate style, you can pair the cut with a short beard.\nThis side part with a taper haircut on the sides is elevated by the short full beard. With side swept hair, the style is sleek and hot. Guys can also combine short hair with any of the different types of fade haircuts.\nThis short haircut looks good with a spiky part and short sides. The stubble beard adds a masculine touch."

You can let the fringe fall naturally or part it for an edgier, manlier appeal, and don\u2019t forget about the iconic blonde highlights.\nGosling also styled a longer hairstyle in La La Land. With short hair on the sides and back to contrast the long hair on top, the Hollywood star wore his signature comb over haircut style\u00a0with well-groomed facial hair."

With a small amount of hair styling product, you can sweep it back or comb it over so that it\u2019s sleek and fashionable. Gosling has a parting, but a sweep or comb over is still gentlemanly as long as it\u2019s polished."

Work in your preferred hair product such as pomade or wax and move everything to the side, including the fringe."

You can do the same by bleaching your hair blonde and cutting in layers to texturize or feather it. You should ask a barber to do the highlights in the beginning and do it yourself once you are more comfortable."

If you\u2019re opting for one of his longer hairstyles, like the one he styled in Crazy Stupid Love, your facial hair should be fuzzier without being unkempt. A good beard shampoo and conditioner can really help stimulate growth and maintain your facial hair.\nStart with some beard balm to moisturize and condition. Use a comb to shape and style your beard properly. Those with shorter hair can recreate a Ryan Gosling beard by ensuring their facial hair is the same length as their hair."
